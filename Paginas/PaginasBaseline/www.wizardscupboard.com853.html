<div>There is a lot to cover today, so I&#8217;m going to skip the introduction.  Let the Battle for Zendikar review commence!</div>
<address> </address>
<h1><strong>White</strong></h1>
<address style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EmeriaShepherd.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-743" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EmeriaShepherd-215x300.jpg" alt="EmeriaShepherd" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EmeriaShepherd-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EmeriaShepherd.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Out of the cycle of expensive creatures with landfall, Emeria Shepherd is the strongest. Landfall to reanimate a creature is a powerful effect. Unfortunately, seven mana will probably be enough to keep the Angel from seeing any constructed play. Reanimating creatures needs to be substantially cheaper than casting them, or it isn’t really worth the effort. There are only a few creatures in standard that actually cost more than seven mana. It’s a cool effect, but it won’t be showing up in constructed.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FelidarSovereign.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-747" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FelidarSovereign-215x300.jpg" alt="FelidarSovereign" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FelidarSovereign-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FelidarSovereign.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>This is a reprint from the original Zendikar block, and it will probably make just as much of an impact this time around. Felidar Sovereign saw approximately zero play last time, and I don&#8217;t see much reason for that to change.  Reaching 40 life without cards dedicated to that purpose is hard, and Felidar Sovereign’s trigger is too slow, and the creature is fragile (any creature is relatively easy to handle, something like Test of Endurance would be more reliable).  It is more likely to see play simply as a 4/6 creature with Vigilance and Lifelink, but Dragonlord Dromoka will probably steal that spot.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GideonAllyOfZendikar.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-749" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GideonAllyOfZendikar-215x300.jpg" alt="GideonAllyOfZendikar" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GideonAllyOfZendikar-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GideonAllyOfZendikar.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>This guy seems completely bananas. He has three separate abilities that can be activated immediately, and they are all powerful effects. He is capable of protecting himself with 2/2 Knight Ally tokens. He presents a fast clock by attacking as an indestructible 5/5, and he can strengthen an army with the Glorious Anthem emblem. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar plays very well in multiples since the first one can generate an emblem, allowing you to cast another one.</p>
<p>Aggressive decks can use Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to continue developing their board without overextending into a sweeper effect.  Those decks are the best suited to using the -4 abilty for +1/+1 to creatures.  Control decks can use Gideon for a stream of blockers.  Gideon can also pressure other Planeswalkers, which control decks can often struggle with.  Gideon can also just win the game with a little protection.</p>
<p>Gideon, Ally of Zendikar pretty much does it all. He can be a single card army. He can protect your or your other planeswalkers with tokens. He can straight up kill an opponent on his own. He has ally synergy. He slices, he dices… I think I’ve said enough. This guy is an easy home run.  Your white deck will need a good reason not to play Gideon, Ally of Zendikar.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/HeroOfGomaFada.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-754" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/HeroOfGomaFada-215x300.jpg" alt="HeroOfGomaFada" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/HeroOfGomaFada-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/HeroOfGomaFada.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Hero of Goma Fada is one of several fairly expensive rare Allies in BFZ. They are all fairly strong, but an aggressive deck (which Allies have traditionally been) can only play a few of them. Hero of Goma Fada makes your creatures indestructible, which is good but not spectacular. Without a way to trigger this at instant speed, this only allows you to alpha strike your creatures into your opponents board without fear. It doesn’t kill an opponent any faster or make any of your creatures larger. Unless Hero of Goma Fada can be used as protection from Wrath effects, I doubt he will see much play.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LanternScout.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-756" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LanternScout-215x300.jpg" alt="LanternScout" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LanternScout-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LanternScout.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Lantern Scout should see at least sideboard play in any Ally deck in BFZ. It will make racing against any other aggressive decks an absolute joke. The body is fairly underwhelming on its own, so it any chance to make the main deck of an Ally deck will depend on it fitting the curve.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PlanarOutburst.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-768" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PlanarOutburst-215x300.jpg" alt="PlanarOutburst" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PlanarOutburst-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PlanarOutburst.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>So long End Hostilities, we barely knew you. The extra text on End Hostilities (dealing with Bestow and Equipment) was never particularly relevant, and the Awaken ability on Planar Outburst is extremely useful. The only reason End Hostilities might not become obsolete is that Planar Outburst doesn’t handle opposing Awakened lands. If there are enough playable cards with Awaken, which looks likely, a white control deck might be more interested in dealing with opposing lands instead of having access to an incidental win condition.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuarantineField.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-770" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuarantineField-215x300.jpg" alt="QuarantineField" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuarantineField-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuarantineField.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Quarantine Field is comparable to Utter End and Silence the Believers, and I expect it to see about as much play as those did. I expect it will make an appearance, but not show up often or in large numbers. Removing multiple permanents is quite strong, but the first test for removal is whether or not it costs less than its intended target. Unholy Hunger won’t be making an appearance in standard ever. Quarantine Field has some additional applications, providing an answer to planeswalkers without using black mana or access to enchantment removal without Dromoka’s Command or narrow sideboard cards. This will occasionally show up in decks, but only with a specific purpose. If Ob Nixilis keeps beating a theoretical U/W control deck, Quarantine Field can fix that problem.   That is the kind of effect Quarantine Field will have in standard.</p>

<p>This is another limited bomb that will have a difficult time pushing its way into standard. Sacrificing an Eldrazi Scion to tap a creature is a decent effect, but Drowner of Hope costs too much to make it truly appealing. Drowner of Hope only produces two Eldrazi Scion to activate it, and those spawn are fragile enough that they cannot be completely relied upon. Overall, it could possibly see play as a singleton with From Beyond. That enchantment can both find it and provide a continuous stream of fodder for Drowner of Hope.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ExertInfluence.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-745" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ExertInfluence-215x300.jpg" alt="ExertInfluence" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ExertInfluence-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ExertInfluence.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Wizards of the Coast has determined that Mind Control without a drawback is too strong for limited play, so they keep printing new variations with a drawback. Mind Control never saw much constructed play, so any of the worse variations are even less likely to make an appearance. I don’t see Exert Influence being any different.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuardianOfTazeem.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-752" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuardianOfTazeem-215x300.jpg" alt="GuardianOfTazeem" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuardianOfTazeem-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuardianOfTazeem.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>They couldn’t find a better card than this to spoil during the Magic World Championship? The card is fine, but it won’t be a constructed powerhouse. To make sure the ability triggers, Guardian of Tazeem will often need to be played on turn six instead of turn five. The body is respectable, but nothing outstanding. It does play well with Languish and the tango lands (the new BFZ dual lands), so I wouldn’t rule it out completely. Guardian of Tazeem might be a role player, but it will struggle to outperform some of the dragon finishers already legal in Standard.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PartTheWaterveil.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-767" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PartTheWaterveil-215x300.jpg" alt="PartTheWaterveil" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PartTheWaterveil-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PartTheWaterveil.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>This kind of effect is flashy and cool, but it rarely makes its way into tournament Magic. This effect is even more expensive than normal too, making it even harder to play. For a Time Walk to see play, a player needs to be generating a bunch of value each turn, whether by drawing additional cards, activating Planeswalkers, or finding some other method to abuse the extra time.  Using a Time Walk effect to simply draw a card and play a land (Explore) is not good enough.  Currently, the Sphinx’s Tutelage deck is the only place Part the Waterveil might see play. That deck runs both Jace and Monastary Siege, so there is some value from an extra turn. However, that deck struggles more from finding Sphinx’s Tutelage than from winning the game after finding it. Playing a six mana spell that only does something when the deck functioning properly doesn’t seem like a good use of resources. I doubt this will see play.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PrismArray.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-769" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PrismArray-215x300.jpg" alt="PrismArray" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PrismArray-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PrismArray.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>An activated ability to Scry 3 seems sweet, but I doubt Prism Array has a place in Standard. Tumble Magnet saw a little play, but it was mostly a response to the prevalence of Sword of Body and Mind/Sword of Feast and Famine/Sword of War and Peace in that format. The tapping effect becomes far less effective as the mana cost increases, and Prism Array has a hard cap on how many times it can use that effect. This shouldn’t be making any waves in constructed Magic.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ScatterToTheWinds.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-774" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ScatterToTheWinds-215x300.jpg" alt="ScatterToTheWinds" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ScatterToTheWinds-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ScatterToTheWinds.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>The new counterspell will be replacing Dissolve, whether control mages want it or not. Dissolve’s Scry effect was extremely relevant in smoothing out early draws. Scatter to the Winds trades the early consistency with a late game creature. Overall, Scatter to the Winds is probably worse than Dissolve, but it won’t matter unless we get Dissolve back. Scatter to the Winds is the best counterspell available without a drawback, so any deck looking for that effect will play it.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UginsInsight.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-780" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UginsInsight-215x300.jpg" alt="UginsInsight" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UginsInsight-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UginsInsight.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>There is some pretty steep competition for drawing cards in Standard, so there are a lot of boxes Ugin’s Insight will have to check to make it in standard</p>
<p>The deck will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger the Scry effect for several cards</li>
<li>Not be able to fuel Delve for Treasure Cruise or have too many competing Delve cards to run a satisfactory number of Treasure Cruise/Dig Through Time</li>
<li>Not run dragons, or choose not to use Dragonlord’s Perogative</li>
<li>Not be black or be concerned enough about life to pass on Painful Truths or Read the Bones</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seems like a steep enough challenge that I doubt Ugin’s Insight will see play in constructed Magic.</p>

<p>Sanguine Bond is the easy comparison, and Defiant Brood is a little bit worse. The higher mana cost makes it harder to build around, and a creature is much more fragile than an enchantment. Sanguine Bond didn’t make an impact on constructed last time, so I doubt Defiant Broodlord will this time. Looks like an EDH card to me.</p>

<p>Now this is a vampire I can get excited about!  An aggressive black deck will be happy to use an aggressively costed threat that continuously pumps attackers. Drana’s First Strike is very important, as her trigger will happen before the rest of your creatures deal damage, making them all larger. Creatures like Avatar of the Resolute and Hangarback Walker synergize well with the +1/+1 counters.</p>
<p>Drana, Liberator of Malakir’s biggest weakness will probably be a lack of a home. Black has not had a lot of recent success with aggressive strategies, and several of the most aggressive creatures will rotate with Theros. Bloodsoaked Champion is the only premium one cost creature black has left. Drana might find a home in an Ally deck with Kalastria Healer and Zulaport Cutthroat, as black got some of the strongest cheap Ally creatures. I’m not sure there is enough power to make a competitive deck, but I hope Drana finds a place somewhere.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuulDrazOverseer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-753" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuulDrazOverseer-215x300.jpg" alt="GuulDrazOverseer" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuulDrazOverseer-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GuulDrazOverseer.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Like all the other cards in the cycle of “big creatures with an improved landfall trigger,” Guul Draz Overseer is too expensive to make it in standard. The Overseer works best with a swarm of little creatures, and a six cost creature is not something those decks have any interest in. Drana, Liberator of Malakir is half the price and her effect is permanent.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ObNixilisReignited.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-763" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ObNixilisReignited-215x300.jpg" alt="ObNixilisReignited" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ObNixilisReignited-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ObNixilisReignited.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Ob Nixilis Reignites has more than enough power to find a place in Standard. Any deck that is interested in making a game last a long time should be interested in a planeswalker that kills creatures and draws cards. Ob Nixilis has you covered. The plus ability is an activation of Necropotence, drawing a card at the cost of one life. The minus ability kills a creature, no questions asked. The ultimate is fairly strong, killing an opponent fairly quickly and not reliant on creatures to support it.  All of the abilities on Ob Nixilis are very clear, making him one of the easiest planeswalkers to evaluate.</p>
<p>Ob Nixilis Reignited might be relegated to the sideboard if the format is extremely aggressive, but he will find a spot somewhere. Siege Rhino and Den Protector will make sure someone wants to play a slow, grindy game.  Ob Nixilis Reginited will find a home in standard.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PainfulTruths.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-766" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PainfulTruths-215x300.jpg" alt="PainfulTruths" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PainfulTruths-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PainfulTruths.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>I believe this card is both very good and noticeably stronger than Read the Bones. Drawing a third card instead of getting Scry 2 is more valuable in every circumstance beyond digging for a specific card. Most decks that have run Read the Bones have been interested in drawing more cards to win an attrition fight, not combo decks looking for a specific piece. The Scry effect on Read the Bones usually just pushed lands to the bottom, but BFZ standard has the Awaken mechanic to help alleviate mana flood. That, along with the manlands, means that additional lands are more desirable than they otherwise might be. The loss of life is a real cost, but it is only punishing against aggressive decks. There is an option to cast Painful Truths with fewer than three colors colors when you have to preserve life points. Paying three mana and a life for a single card is not remotely good, but it is a free alternative on the card. Any midrange deck that plays black should definitely consider Painful Truths if they are in the market for a card draw spell.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RuinousPath.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-772" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RuinousPath-215x300.jpg" alt="RuinousPath" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RuinousPath-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RuinousPath.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Hero’s Downfall is here to stay. Well, maybe not quite Hero&#8217;s Downfall. Ruinous Path is a sorcery instead of an instant, but it gains Awaken. The downgrade to sorcery speed should reduce the number of decks interested in it. I could see a deck like Esper Dragons moving to Utter End instead, so the shields don’t have to go down for counterspells. Abzan would prefer the card to be an instant, but the option for late-game value is appealing enough that it should slot Ruinous Path into the existing deck. This will definitely find a place in Standard, as it is both versatile and the cheapest way to remove a planeswalker from the battlefield.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SmotheringAbomination.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-779" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SmotheringAbomination-215x300.jpg" alt="SmotheringAbomination" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SmotheringAbomination-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SmotheringAbomination.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Someday, someone will break this card. I’m not sure what the combo will be, but “Whenever you sacrifice a creature, draw a card” is a very powerful line of text. As an aggressive threat, Smoldering Abomination is a respectable 4/3 flyer for four mana. There are synergies with Butcher of the Horde, Evolutionary Leap, Nantuko Husk, and possibly Fleshbag Marauder as sacrifice outlets. Bloodsoaked Champion and Despoiler of Souls are recursive threats that can keep Smoldering Abomination in play. Abomination does not specify non-token creatures, so Eldrazi Scions, Hangarback Walker, Hordeling Outburst, Secure the Waste, and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar could all be used to convert tokens into cards. Liliana, Heretical Healer also has sacrifice synergy, so that might be another angle for a deck. If used fairly, Smoldering Abomination is probably not strong enough to warrant its own deck in standard without additional sacrifice synergies. If enough synergies exist to warrant a sacrifice deck, Smoldering Abomination will be drawing a lot of cards.</p>

<p>Wasteland Strangler is bananas if you can activate him. Getting a card into exile within the first two turns could be a little bit of a struggle, but the reward would be worth it. Wasteland Strangler creates a huge tempo swing in the early turns, killing your opponent’s biggest creature while getting one yourself. Fathom Feeder, Horribly Awry, Silkwrap, Suspension Field, and Transgress the Mind are all constructed playable cards capable of setting up a Wasteland Strangler on curve, but none of them are guaranteed to work on turn two. Still, any deck capable of reliably exiling cards should be utilizing Wasteland Strangler, and I expect it to make a mark on standard.</p>

<p>Aroum Firebird is a durable threat, being able to return from the graveyard if you start to flood out on mana. The “attack each turn if able” line is a very dangerous line of text, as the format is currently has the set of Dragonlords that can all block the phoenix down. I imagine this guy is a little better than Flamewake Phoenix, since the recursion ability does not rely on Ferocious. That’s not a huge endorsement though, and I’m not expecting to see much of the phoenix in standard.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AkoumHellkite.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-726" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AkoumHellkite-215x300.jpg" alt="AkoumHellkite" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AkoumHellkite-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AkoumHellkite.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>This dragon seems completely absurd in limited, but large creatures with Landfall will have a hard time in constructed. The Hellkite costs an additional mana if you want to ensure you get at least one trigger from it. Akoum Hellkite’s trigger is just so underwhelming unless you have a way to abuse it (think lots of Explosive Vegetation), and that seems like way too much work for too little payoff.</p>

<p>There is a small chance this guy becomes relevant, due to the ability to fling large objects (your creatures) at your opponent’s face. Paying five mana for a three toughness creature is a pretty steep cost though, and it needs to survive a turn cycle before it does anything. Barrage Tyrant is not priced for constructed play.</p>

<p>This is a reprint, so the only work we have to do is deciding if it can fit in the new standard. It does scale, since it is a serviceable (if unexciting) play on turn one, while beginning to shine around turn seven. Unfortunately, the trigger is a little slow, and the body on Dragonmaster Outcast is extremely weak. I don’t expect this card to make much of an impact in constructed.</p>

<p>This sweeper will be competing with Seismic Rupture for a place in Standard. Radiant Flames is both more versatile and more powerful, so it should easily find a place in standard. Destroying Thopter tokens and dealing a third point of damage will overshadow any minor consistency problems. There might be some issues with too many colorless lands reducing the power of Radiant Flames, but that is more a problem with deck construction. This card will definitely see play in standard.</p>

<p>This is an extremely expensive damage spell that requires multiple targets to even work. I’m sure this will be a bomb in limited, but it will not see constructed play.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ZadaHedronGrinder.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-787" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ZadaHedronGrinder-215x300.jpg" alt="ZadaHedronGrinder" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ZadaHedronGrinder-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ZadaHedronGrinder.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>This guy does some stuff. I personally think there are a few too many hoops to jump through to make Zada, Hedron Grinder do something profitable, but I’m sure there are brewers out there already hard at work. Defiant Strike seems like the strongest card to pair with Zada, since drawing a million cards is awesome. Zada is an Ally, but I don’t expect it to find its way into many Ally decks. Space not used on Allies is at a premium, since the cards are quite weak if you can’t trigger them reliably. Zada, Hedron Grinder will likely find a home among Goblin tokens, since both Dragon Fodder and Hordeling Outburst provide great targets for Zada, Hedron Grinder’s trigger.</p>
<p>I expect there is a home for Zada in EDH, but I don’t think it will be super likely to break out in standard. If it does find a place, the reason will be a lack of removal that can interact with it. Black’s premier removal spell is now a sorcery, white can’t really interact with it outside of combat or sorcery speed, and red is reduced to Fiery Impulse and Draconic Roar to kill it. It’s not out of the realm of possibility, but I don’t really expect to see Zada in standard.</p>

<p>Apparently this is what we get for mana acceleration now. The creature restriction will keep prevent Beastcaller Savant from seeing play in any deck marginally interested in noncreature spells. It is both an Elf and and Ally, both tribes with standard support. Elves decks only splash for a small number of black creatures, so Beastcaller Savant doesn’t look likely to find a home there. It is one of the few pieces of color fixing for an Ally deck, so that shows the most promise. Haste means he can actually color fix the turn you cast him, simply by adding a green mana to a creature you couldn’t already cast. Beastcaller Savant is not a flashy card, but it will be a good support card in an Ally deck if one appears in standard.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FromBeyond.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-748" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FromBeyond-215x300.jpg" alt="FromBeyond" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FromBeyond-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FromBeyond.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>The easy comparison is to Awakening Zone. The extra cost in mana is a difficult hurdle to overcome, but From Beyond has a couple advantages. Eldrazi Scions are significantly more powerful than Eldrazi Spawn, since a point of power makes them a threat instead of just inconsistent ramp and chump blockers. From Beyond also serves as a tutor effect once it had produced enough mana, so it is never a dead draw. It will probably be difficult for From Beyond to ever become too prominent, as Dromoka’s Command will rear its ugly head if enchantments become prominent. Even if it isn’t good enough for the inevitable Eldrazi ramp deck, From Beyond will be a decent card against the control decks of the format.</p>

<p>Yay, we get more Eternal Witness effects for Standard. The general consensus is that Den Protector is the stronger card, as there are more options on when to play her. I’m not sure I completely agree, since Greenwarden of Murasa has some upside. My favorite is the synergy with See the Unwritten. Greenwarden can be found with See the Unwritten, and then immediately return it to your hand to recast (now with ferocious). Greenwarden of Murasa can also get into a fight with Siege Rhino or Tasigur and at least trade. Den Protector can function as a three drop and has synergy with Deathmist Raptor, but I still think there will be a place in constructed for Greenwarden of Murasa.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NissasRenewal.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-760" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NissasRenewal-215x300.jpg" alt="NissasRenewal" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NissasRenewal-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NissasRenewal.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>There is a fairly strong comparison between Nissa’s Renewal and Dreamstone Hedron. Unfortunately, Dreamstone Hedron was not a strong constructed card during the original Eldrazi invasion. Ramp that only works after you have done work generating mana is not a great place to be. Instead of shortening the game by getting to Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger faster, something like Dragonlord Atarka seems like a stronger way to bridge the gap. Dragonlord Atarka could just win the game before Ulamog even makes an appearance.</p>
<p>Unfortunatley, a ramp deck can only play a limited number of expensive spells. Oblivion Sower and Conduit of Ruin both come with a respectable body and work with Shaman of Forgotten Ways, so Nissa’s Renewal has its work cut out to become the premier expensive ramp spell in BFZ standard. The life from Nissa’s Renewal reminds me of Sphinx’s Revelation, giving you enough time to make use of the mana generated.  Nissa&#8217;s Renewal is the most reliable ramp spell out of the ones I listed, and that could be enough to find it a home.</p>

<p>The hydra is very close to Akoum Hellkite, except the trigger is worse. Having a big, expensive creature that doesn’t do anything besides getting bigger isn’t good enough for constructed play. I’m sure it will wreck some people in limited and at the kitchen table, but nothing past that.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UndergrowthChampion.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-782" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UndergrowthChampion-215x300.jpg" alt="UndergrowthChampion" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UndergrowthChampion-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UndergrowthChampion.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>There has been a lot of hype for Undergrowth Champion, but I just don’t see the appeal here. He needs a landfall trigger to put his shield up, so he will either be vulnerable for a turn or he effectively costs four mana. Siege Rhino costs four mana, so I don’t really think Undergrowth Champion stacks up to the competition. Abzan could run Undergrowth Champion, but it would have to find room for more creatures after Anafenza, the Foremost, Den Protector, Siege Rhino, and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar. There really aren’t any other green decks looking for an aggressive creature right now.  A deck with Hardened Scales might be interested, but that is because Undergrowth Champion has some synergy there.</p>
<p>One last note; Undergrowth Champion is a three cost creature that dies to Wild Slash. That seems like a pretty embarrassing place to be. Wild Slash with Ferocious still kills Undergrowth Champion with a counter. The counter is removed automatically, but the damage cannot be prevented.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WoodlandWanderer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-786" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WoodlandWanderer-215x300.jpg" alt="WoodlandWanderer" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WoodlandWanderer-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WoodlandWanderer.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Woodland Wanderer is essentially a four mana 6/6 with Trample and Vigilance. Sometimes it will only be a 5/5, but any deck using it will be able to produce at least 4 different colors of mana. Siege Rhino has proven that an undercosted body is quite powerful, but Woodland Wanderer doesn’t really match up. It’s definitely bigger, but it doesn’t have any effect on the game outside of combat. Rhino provides reach with the damage part of the trigger and can help stabilize you with the life from the trigger. Woodland Wanderer just sits there hoping that a Vigilance creature can block well enough to matter.</p>
<p>Woodland Wanderer is not a bad creature, but it will suffer from only fitting into one type of deck. Unfortunately, that deck will be a four to five color midrange deck, and there are just so many other options available. To find room, you’ll have to Woodland Wanderer over another four drop like Gideon, Ally of Justice, Siege Rhino, Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, Thunderbreak Regent, Kiora, Master of the Depths, Languish, Ojutai’s Command, and Sorin, Solemn Visitor.  Woodland Wanderer&#8217;s French Vanilla body seems like a waste when you are passing up on all the other four drops available.</p>

<p>This is a five mana 4/3 flyer with a marginal ability in combat. Angelic Captain will be a strong limited card, but Angel collectors will be the only other people interested after the draft is over.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BringToLight.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-733" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BringToLight-215x300.jpg" alt="BringToLight" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BringToLight-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BringToLight.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>I really, really, really want this card to be good, but I have some reservations about five color decks in BFZ standard. If it wasn’t obvious, this card isn’t very good if you aren’t at least four colors, preferably five. I’ve got some reservations about the viability of a five color deck in this format, mostly due to the difficulty building the manabase.  Not that it is difficult to fit in all the colors, but what you give up to make the room. The real problem comes from Lumbering Falls and Shambling Vent. The if mana in a five color deck can’t incorporate those manlands, it will be at a severe disadvantage to the decks that can.</p>
<p>That might not be enough to hold Bring to Light back.  In a midrange deck, this card can be Dragonlord Ojutai, Siege Rhino, Languish, Utter End, or any number of other cards.  That much versatility cannot be understated.  If a five color midrange deck appears in standard, it will be on the strength of this card.</p>
<p>There are some other possibilities beyond sticking Bring to Light in a midrange shell. If your combo deck absolutely has to resolve Zada, Hedron Grinder, Bring to Light can act as an additional four copies of the card. Unfortunately, Bring to Light can’t find enchantments, otherwise it would have been an easy addition for Jeskai Ascendancy decks. There is definitely some potential here, but it could take a while to find a home.</p>
<p>There is a little Modern potential in a card that can both find and cast spells. Scapeshift might be the easiest deck to modify with Bring to Light. A light splash color can add four more virtual copies of Scapeshift to the deck. Bring to Light can also cast any of the free spells from Time Spiral (Living End, Wheel of Fate, and Restore Balance). Ad Nauseum is another spell based combo deck that might find a use for Bring to Light, but the mana might prove to be too difficult.</p>

<p>This guy just doesn’t have the stats to keep up in constructed. Turning Eldrazi Scions into removal spells will be fantastic in limited, but paying two mana and losing a creature for -2/-2 is not good enough outside of 40 card decks. A 3/3 for five mana is nothing to get excited for either, even if it comes with an Eldrazi Scion.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BrutalExpulsion.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-735" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BrutalExpulsion-215x300.jpg" alt="BrutalExpulsion" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BrutalExpulsion-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BrutalExpulsion.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>There are a lot of options on Brutal Expulsion, so let’s cover the range of options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remand a spell</li>
<li>Unsummon a creature</li>
<li>Shock a creature</li>
<li>Shock a planeswalker</li>
<li>A and C</li>
<li>A and D</li>
<li>B and C</li>
<li>B and D</li>
</ol>
<p>The cards Venser, Shaper Savant and Jilt could both be used as comparisons to get a grasp on how good Brutal Expulsion will be. I don’t believe Jilt saw much constructed play, but Venser certainly made an appearance. One of Venser’s strengths was the ability to flicker it to reuse the effect, and Brutal Expulsion won’t be able to share that. Jace, Telepath Unbound could give it flashback, but that is not very strong as a sorcery speed effect.</p>
<p>If some sort of a blue red tempo deck appears in the BFZ standard format, I could see a couple copies Brutal Expulsion in the deck. It isn’t strong enough to warrant its own deck though.  It will be a role player at best.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DustStalker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-742" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DustStalker-215x300.jpg" alt="DustStalker" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DustStalker-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DustStalker.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Dust Stalker is kind of like Ball Lightning, which is enough to get me interested. That has more to do with my personal love of Ball Lightning than any real power Dust Stalker might have. If there is an aggressive red and black deck looking for a finisher, Dust Stalker is serviceable. It’s not a strong card, so it would only see play until something more exciting is printed. It likely won’t see any play at all.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FathomFeeder.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-746" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FathomFeeder-215x300.jpg" alt="FathomFeeder" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FathomFeeder-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FathomFeeder.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Fathom Feeder feels like a cross between Azure Mage and Baleful Strix, which are both playable cards. This is a safe bet for constructed, as the cheap mana cost means it has a lower bar to overcome in reaching competitive play. Also, if the Eldrazi Processors are going to make it to constructed Magic, they will need a critical mass of enablers. Fathom Feeder is the only creature with Ingest that appears strong enough to get the job done. Fathom Feeder will see constructed play for that reason alone.</p>
<p>In control matchups, it provides a source of card advantage and is a small clock. Technically it could block down a large creature, but control will probably use planeswalkers, Dragonlords, or Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to end games. Still, it will demand an answer eventually, or the steady stream of cards will overwhelm anyone looking to play a long game.</p>
<p>Against aggro, it can easily trade with a 2-3 cost creature, or it will be the target of a removal spell. Pure control decks won’t want to present targets for cards like Wild Slash, but Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy means there is already a target. Once those decks have a target for their removal spells, it isn’t as punishing to play more creatures.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/KioraMasterOfTheDepths.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-755" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/KioraMasterOfTheDepths-215x300.jpg" alt="KioraMasterOfTheDepths" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/KioraMasterOfTheDepths-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/KioraMasterOfTheDepths.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Overall, I think Kiora, Master of the Depths is solid but unspectacular. The plus ability feels like a variation of Garruk Wildspeaker’s plus ability. It is less reliable ramp, but it gives a chance to protect Kiora, Master of the Depths. The minus ability is a solid method for drawing action, particularly with the option to find a manland and a creature. Filling the graveyard is a serious bonus, as the Delve mechanic isn’t going anywhere at rotation. Unfortunately, the best blue Delve cards are spells that cannot be found with the minus ability. Kiora, Master of the Depths’s ultimate is good but underwhelming. Drawing several cards from the minus ability will often be better than the ultimate. Kiora’s ultimate generates a huge board, but it is vulnerable to a wrath effect. You likely already had board control considering Kiora survived five turns to use the ultimate, so the ultimate seems fairly bad.</p>
<p>Kiora feels like a card that will see some play if a blue green deck emerges for other reasons. Kiora isn’t strong enough to warrant her own deck, but a couple could slot into a deck if it emerges for other reasons.</p>

<p>This is a cool reanimation effect for an Ally deck, and there are two distinct ways to use it. The first would be filling your deck with cards like Gather the Pack to actively fill your graveyard. This has a combo application with something like a bunch of Kalastria Healers in your graveyard. The other option would be using March from the Tomb as a sideboard card against sweeper effects. I think this will be the most useful option, as the loss of Satyr Wayfinder will hurt self mill strategies.</p>

<p>This guy is certainly capable of giving you a steady stream of creatures. He should prevent any bad top decks, provided you don’t need additional lands or removal. The effect is good, but he will be reliant on cheaper Allies to make a cohesive deck. If there are only a few Allies you really want to find every game, Munda is good a searching for them.  There is some pretty steep competition at the four mana spot, between Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Unified Front, and Collected Company.  Munda might be the weakest in terms of raw power, but it is the best at finding a specific creature due to the repeated effect.</p>
<p>If an Ally deck shows up again in Modern, Munda, Ambush Leader has some great synergy with Lead the Stampede.</p>

<p>I don’t expect Noyan Dar to do much shaping in standard. He has the capability to generate an entire army on his own, but there aren’t enough enablers are present to make it really work. Talrand, Sky Summoner had a high supply of cheap blue spells to fuel it, and we just don’t have those now. Talrand wasn’t a particularly strong card even with all the support. Wizards of the Coast has been hesitant to print cheap card selection, and it isn’t likely to appear in a format with Delve. Noyan Dar is a lightning rod, instantly attracting removal spells. He won’t generate enough value before he dies to be worth the effort of casting him.</p>

<p>I’m gonna go ahead and get this out of the way &#8211; I’m going to get decimated by this card at some point in my life. My opponent is going to generate a million tokens and just bury me in the ground. That said, I don’t think Omnath is very good. All of the expensive Landfall creatures cost an additional mana unless they are strong enough without the trigger (I don’t think any qualify), so Omnath really costs eight mana for a pair of 5/5 creatures. I am well aware that he will produce an army if you get to untap, that there is synergy with anything that puts lands into play, and that there is extra value with fetch lands, but all of that is just icing on the cake. Any threat that costs seven mana should be capable of winning the game singlehandedly. The problem in standard now is that it will be competing with Dragonlord Atarka for space, and Atarka’s trigger just seems better. There is a chance Omnath sees play in a ramp deck, but a lot of things need to go right:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deck needs room and have a desire to vary its threats</li>
<li>Any expensive ramp spell needs to trigger landfall (not Conduit of Ruin)</li>
<li>Not running Titan’s Presence</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect the ramp decks to just run 4 Ulamog and some number of Dragonlords and leave it at that. Oblivion Sower/Conduit of Ruin should provide enough support to finish the game.</p>

<p>The return of Consecrated Sphinx is pretty disappointing. The strength of the sphinx was that you were guaranteed the cards unless they had an instant speed removal spell. The opponent can deny draw from this guy as long as necessary to find an answer, turning it into a vanilla 5/7 for six with no evasion. That doesn’t feel strong enough to see play. If control decks are interested in a big flashy finisher, Dragonlord Silumgar or Ugin, the Spirit Dragon are more likely to see play.  There might be a weekend where this is a good metagame choice for control mirrors, but it won&#8217;t be making a regular appearance.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VeteranWarleader.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-783" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VeteranWarleader-215x300.jpg" alt="VeteranWarleader" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VeteranWarleader-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VeteranWarleader.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Veteran Warleader is likely to suffer from the overall low power of Ally creatures in BFZ. Most of them are too weak for standard, and Veteran Warleader needs strong support from one and two mana creatures. If Veteran Warleader comes down as a 1/1 or a 2/2, it will be awful. Unified Front and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar can help grow the Veteran Warleader, but I don’t know if it is even worth the effort. Scion of the Wild variants have rarely seen play before. The ability to give Veteran Warleader Trample is strong, but I don’t know if that is good enough to push it into standard.  There will also be competition with Drana, Liberator of Malakir for the three mana slot in an Ally deck, further reducing the chance of it seeing play.</p>

<p>This should serve as a decent answer for decks filled with Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Dragonlord Atarka. Missing cards like Siege Rhino, Tasigur, the Golden Fang, and every card that could possibly go into a red deck means that Aligned Hedron Network will be relegated to the sideboard card.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BlightHerder.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-732" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BlightHerder-215x300.jpg" alt="BlightHerder" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BlightHerder-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BlightHerder.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Being able to trigger the ability will make all the difference with Blight Herder. If enough decks are playing Delve or if a deck can be build with enough ingest, Blight Herder is a fantastic army-in-a-can. It can attack for seven a turn, curves directly into Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and does a fair bit of work getting to Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger mana. If he doesn’t trigger reliably, a 4/5 for five is just plain awful. A deck capable of reliably exiling cards early will look to Blight Herder and Wasteland Strangler as the two most powerful Processors.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ConduitOfRuin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-736" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ConduitOfRuin-215x300.jpg" alt="ConduitOfRuin" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ConduitOfRuin-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ConduitOfRuin.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Conduit of Ruin has potential, but the competition is steep. Finding a big threat is very valuable, but the ramp is reliant on Conduit of Ruin staying in play. Nissa&#8217;s Renewal is the most consistent ramp spell, but it provides life and no creature.  Oblivion Sower provides a larger body, but doesn&#8217;t guarantee any mana.  Conduit&#8217;s trigger is at odds with Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, since the two mana creature reduction doesn’t completely bridge the mana gap to ten mana. Void Winnower could be cast without that problem, so they might be able to work well together. Ulamog is far more likely than Void Winnower to see play, so I&#8217;m not sure how much that even matters. The tension between Conduit of Ruin and Ulamog might keep it out of standard until we get some stronger 8-9 mana Eldrazi.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DesolationTwin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-738" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DesolationTwin-215x300.jpg" alt="DesolationTwin" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DesolationTwin-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DesolationTwin.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>This guy is fairly unique, as simply casting him presents lethal damage. I can’t think of anything besides Marit Lage that has been capable of doing that. However, it’s really just a big dumb creature (well, a couple of them). Desolation Twin has no evasion or method to protect itself, and is only partially protected from counterspells (Desolation Twin triggers upon casting it, so you get the token even if it is countered). Even with the large size, it doesn’t stack up well against Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. Ulamog protects itself, immediately clears some of the board, and wins in three attacks without even needing to deal combat damage. Desolation Twin is just big. It is probably the second Eldrazi ramp target after Ulamog, so it might see some play. Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and/or Dragonlord Atarka might steal any chance Desolation Twin had to make it in standard.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EndlessOne.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-744" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EndlessOne-215x300.jpg" alt="EndlessOne" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EndlessOne-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EndlessOne.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>It’s pretty hard to argue about how well this guy scales up your mana curve. It will be a decent powered threat at any point that it is convenient to cast. However, vanilla creatures are a ways away from constructed playable, and I don’t think the versatility does enough. Furthermore, I expect Hangarback Walker to steal any slot Endless One might have in the near future, so his prospects are dim.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GruesomeSlaughter.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-751" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GruesomeSlaughter-215x300.jpg" alt="GruesomeSlaughter" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GruesomeSlaughter-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GruesomeSlaughter.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>The new All is Dust appears to have taken a huge hit, downgrading from Plague Wind to Setessan Tactics. Gruesome Slaughter is completely unreliable as a sweeper, and will not be seeing play in any constructed format.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/OblivionSower.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-762" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/OblivionSower-215x300.jpg" alt="OblivionSower" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/OblivionSower-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/OblivionSower.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Oblivion Sower seems like a solid creature for decks interested in ramping to Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The cast trigger should find just under two lands without any additional support. The Eldrazi ramp decks will likely be interested in one of the big ramp spells to bridge from around six mana to Ulamog mana, and Oblivion Sower looks like the frontrunner for the spot. Primeval Titan saw play in the old Eldrazi ramp decks, and Oblivion Sower could fill a similar role. It is a respectable body on its own, and helps generate mana to cast your huge threats. Out of all the expensive ramp spells (Oblivion Sower, Conduit of Ruin, and Nissa’s Renewal), I feel like Oblivion Sower has the best chance of making it in standard.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UlamogTheCeaselessHunger.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-781" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UlamogTheCeaselessHunger-215x300.jpg" alt="UlamogTheCeaselessHunger" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UlamogTheCeaselessHunger-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UlamogTheCeaselessHunger.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>The Eldrazi titans were well known as the biggest, strongest, and largest creatures in Magic, and Ulamog looks capable of competing with them. A lot of things need to go right for a ten mana creature to see play, but Ulamog should fit the bill. His cast trigger will still exile two permanents even if he is countered, he is resilient to removal thanks to being indestructible, and he will win the game in three turns even if he is blocked, thanks to the library exiling trigger. I have high hopes for Ulamog in standard. To be fair, if the marquee creature card of the set doesn’t make it into constructed, I feel that Wizards of the Coast will have had a colossal failure in set design.</p>
<p>My only concern is the lack of a strong companion, with Dragonlord Atarka appearing to be the second strongest ramp target in BFZ standard. Ugin, the Spirit Dragon is another strong ramp target, but Shaman of Forgotten Ways cannot accelerate it. There are options to build a deck without Shaman so I still have faith that a ramp strategy will exist in BFZ standard. Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger should stand at the top of that deck.</p>
<p>One last thing; Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger doesn’t remove himself from a graveyard like the old Eldrazi titans do. Standard doesn’t have good reanimate spells (Fearsome Awakening, Necromantic Summons), but Modern has plenty. Ulamog might not fit into any of the existing decks since he mostly offers a giant body, but that might just be enough. The library exiling is strong versus several Modern decks, with Scapeshift and Amulet Bloom coming to mind immediately. That trigger might earn Ulamog a sideboard slot in decks with Goryo’s Vengeance or a Gifts Ungiven/Unburial Rites package</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VoidWinnower.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-784" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VoidWinnower-215x300.jpg" alt="VoidWinnower" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VoidWinnower-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VoidWinnower.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>I’ll take the high road and avoid all the jokes about how Void Winnower literally can’t even. Fine, I couldn’t help myself, but I’ll get to the point.  In any fair matchup, the text on Void Winnower seems mostly irrelevant. The removal spells that could kill it all cost three (Ruinous Path, Stasis Snare, Abzan Charm), and the Wrath effects all cost five (Planar Outburst, Crux of Fate, End Hostilities). Void Winnower doesn’t even stop attackers, so resolving it won’t stop a lethal attack (unless you just needed a blocker). I think I’d rather just spend one more mana and get a pair of 10/10 creatures.</p>
<p>Void Winnower could still be useful as a tool against combo decks. In Standard, the most likely combo decks revolve around Jeskai Ascendacy and Sphinx’s Tutelage, so Void Winnower doesn’t actuall do anything to stop them. If something new appears, and Void Winnower can shut it down, it might have a chance. From Beyond and Conduit of Ruin both find silver bullet targets, so it is easy to fit one copy in the deck.</p>
<p>Modern has a couple viable targets for Void Winnower to shut off, but it will be competing with Iona, Shield of Emeria for the spot. Iona feels like the slightly stronger card, but it is close.</p>
<p>Void Winnower won’t be making large waves anytime soon, but there is a chance it will show up as a silver bullet</p>

<h1><strong>Land</strong></h1>

<p>This is the Sliver Hive for Ally decks. If you are going to put a bunch of Allies in your deck, you play with four copies of this card. The importance of color fixing cannot be overstated, particularly in a deck that will use at least three colors and probably stretch into all five colors. If you are deciding between picking up another copy of that sweet Ally card for your deck or another Ally Encampment, get the land. Not being able to cast your cards is awful.</p>
<p>Ally Encampment could also be used as protection for a standalone Ally. There are a few that might not be pigeonholed into a five color Ally deck, like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Noyan Dar, Roil Shaper, or Zada, Hedron Grinder. Decks playing any those cards might have to have room for a colorless land. Like Haven of the Spirit Dragon, Ally Encampment could see some amount of play as a utility land.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lands2.bmp"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-695" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lands2.bmp" alt="lands2" width="645" height="300" /></a></address>

<p>I can’t actually think of a time in recent Magic where a set’s cycle of rare dual lands did not drastically impact the standard format. Tango lands was the original nickname, but battle lands seems to be the frontrunner now. The battle lands will have a huge effect on the format. The combined power of the battle lands and the fetch lands will make decks looking to play four or five colors of mana quite reasonable. There is some tension between the Khans of Tarkir three color lands, the manlands, and the battle lands, simply due to the number of basics the battle lands require. Either way, battle lands will be making a mark on standard for the duration of their legality</p>
<p>There is a chance the battle lands break their way into modern. The fetch land/shock land manabase has been dominant for a long time, but the battle lands might start to encroach on their territory. If you want to know more, <a href="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/it-takes-2-to-tango-modern-remix/">I wrote a few thousand words about it on this very site earlier this month</a>.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LumberingFalls.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-757" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LumberingFalls-215x300.jpg" alt="LumberingFalls" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LumberingFalls-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LumberingFalls.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>All of the manlands will be fantastic additions to constructed, provided a deck exists that can play them. The temples from Theros block were quite strong, where the scry ability was almost equivalent to a spell. The manlands are a spell themselves, and should prove to be even stronger. There is a strong president for these lands, with some of the original cycle appearing heavily in Modern and occasionally in Legacy. Midrange decks were going up to 27 lands just to play as many manlands as possible. Any deck running Simic colors will need a very good reason not to play this card.</p>
<p>Control decks don’t want to play against Lumbering Falls. It dodges both spot removal and wrath effects. Without a Tectonic Edge effect in standard, control will have to rely on something like Fathom Feeder to remove it. Some of the big finishers, like the dragonlords or Ulamog can manage it too. Lumbering Falls might just be played as the finisher in a control deck. An opponent can’t interact with it, it is extremely easy to protect, and control wouldn’t have to play dedicated win conditions. Having an opening hand cluttered with dragonlords or Ugins is pretty awful, but replacing those with lands will often make it a strong hand. Lumbering Falls is an easy slam dunk for any deck that can run it.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SanctumOfUgin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-773" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SanctumOfUgin-215x300.jpg" alt="SanctumOfUgin" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SanctumOfUgin-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SanctumOfUgin.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>The colorless spells in standard that cost seven or more are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bane of Bala Ged</li>
<li>Breaker of Armies</li>
<li>Desolation Twin</li>
<li>Eldrazi Devastator</li>
<li>Ruin Processor</li>
<li>Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger</li>
<li>Void Winnower</li>
<li>Mage-Ring Responder</li>
<li>Pilgrim of the Fires</li>
<li>Ugin, the Spirit Dragon</li>
</ul>
<p>I might actually be interested in casting three of those, so the options to trigger it are small. Sanctum of Ugin only fetches creatures (how does this not get Ugin?), so that reduces the list even more. If Sanctum of Ugin is going to see play in standard, it will be as a single copy that can be tutored for with Sylvan Scrying. I don’t expect Sylvan Scrying to make a huge impact in standard, as ramp spells that either find a land and put it in your hand or put a land from your hand into play are not usually powerful enough.</p>
<p>To play this land in multiples, several things would need to occur. Your deck would have to consistently ramp well enough to not need Shrine of the Forsaken Gods or Blighted Woodland. If it needed one of those, the deck would have to be a single color with the ability to run more than four colorless lands.</p>
<p>I expect the ramp decks to use Dragonlord Atarka, as it is a premium ramp target with a proven track record. Sanctum of Ugin works with colorless creatures, and the best one available (Ulamog) is legendary. Sanctum of Ugin would need to fetch a different creature or pick up a redundant copy of your legendary threat. That doesn’t seem like a recipe for success.</p>

<p>The manlands are fantastic additions to Standard, and I&#8217;ll just keep repeating myself in case anyone hasn&#8217;t realized it yet.  Every deck playing white and black should play four of these.  Aggressive decks are the least interested, but manlands help prevent mana flood at virtually no cost.  A 2/3 with lifelink is not exactly an aggressive creature, but its pretty much a freebie.  Slower decks like Abzan and Esper Dragons are going to love this card.  It is a free source of lifegain against red decks, and those decks can&#8217;t easily remove it.  Wild Slash doesn&#8217;t do enough damage, Exquisite Firecraft is a sorcery, and Goblin Heelcutter can&#8217;t target it.  Red mages will be stumbling over Shambling Vents for a long time to come.</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShrineOfTheForsakenGods.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-777" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShrineOfTheForsakenGods-215x300.jpg" alt="ShrineOfTheForsakenGods" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShrineOfTheForsakenGods-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShrineOfTheForsakenGods.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<p>Shrine of the Forsaken Gods is extremely similar to Blighted Woodland. They both produce a colorless land, and can produce a second mana when the condition is satisfied. Blighted Woodland has a couple drawbacks, requiring several mana to activate and thinning your deck of lands when you might need to draw more. However, Blighted Woodland produces colored mana, which is a huge advantage. One of these two lands is likely to be the utility land in ramp decks, unless the resilience provided by Haven of the Spirit Dragon proves too important.</p>
<p>If the big ramp targets are Ulamog and Ugin, Shrine is probably better than Blighted Woodland. Particularly if Nissa’s Renewal is a popular ramp spell, since the deck can only play a finite number of basic lands. Blighted Woodland is more likely to see play if Dragonlord Atarka is a fixture of the ramp decks, as a red splash would be happy for extra fixing.</p>
<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>That covers all the rares and mythics from Battle for Zendikar.  I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts, opinions, and disagreements, so feel free to leave me a comment or find me on Twitter.  Until next time, may all of your packs be filled with Expeditions.</p>
