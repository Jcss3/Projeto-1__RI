<p><strong>By Craig Sidorowicz</strong></p>
<p>“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity&#8221; -Sun Tzu, The Art of War</p>
<p>In this episode of Commander 101, my goal is to impart what I&#8217;ve learned about recognizing and responding to common situations and threats that appear during a typical EDH game.  Further, I will provide insight into how to traverse a path through the game in efficient ways that will put you in the best position to stay active and relevant in your pod, which is how I define &#8220;having fun&#8221; in EDH. Often, executing proper situational awareness and threat assessment will result in a win.  This article comes as a prelude to deckbuilding, because in order to properly build a deck, practical understanding of what one is up against in the format should come first.  Some deck building advice is included, for purposes of example and elaboration.</p>
<p>EDH is an extremely deep and dynamic format, and the threats are quite different than two-player formats. There are so many viable cards and strategies, multiplied by the increase in the number of your opponents, and  further multiplied by the number of different individual play styles. For a player just breaking into the format, these complexities can be overwhelming, and mastery can seem far away.</p>
<p><strong>First, some definitions:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b><i>Situational Awareness</i></b></span>:  The ability to recognize the stage of the game one is in, and the position one is in relative to the opponents.  This includes an understanding of how your opponents will use <em>their</em> situational awareness to respond to your actions.  Masters of situational awareness also have an intuitive grasp of the potential for board wipes, reset buttons, alpha strikes, or the game ending by someone comboing out.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b><i>Threat assessment</i></b></span>:  The ability to understand which player is the most threatening, and then using this assessment to aid in decision making.  This is usually based on available resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mana available</li>
<li>Permanents in play</li>
<li>Cards in hand</li>
<li>General</li>
<li>Cards in graveyard</li>
<li>Life total</li>
</ul>
<p><b>PART ONE: The Four Stages to any EDH Game:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Beginning</i></b>:  all players&#8217; resources are equalized, and barring Leylines, the board is at a neutral state.  Commanders are placed face-up in the command zone.</li>
<li><b><i>Building</i></b>:  players begin to build their mana base, sculpt a hand, establish defenses, launch early attacks.  The game can progress beyond this stage, but then quickly return to this stage if the board is wiped or reset (Wrath of God, Cyclonic Rift).  Therefore, I also call this stage: &#8220;<strong>Rebuilding</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li><b><i>Escalation</i></b>: this is where the battles take place, often climaxing in one player taking control by overwhelming the others with resources, or by stepping into a power vacuum left after several players have expended/exhausted their resources battling one another.</li>
<li><b><i>Ending</i></b>: players begin to die from attrition of resources, or one player executes a combo or an overwhelming attack that finishes the other opponents instantly, or locks the board state causing submission or &#8220;scoop phase&#8221; from their opponents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, the most successful decks are built to maximize performance during each of these stages, and the best players recognize how to navigate through and wrest &#8220;control&#8221; each of these stages from our opponents.</p>
<p>This is not the whole story however.  The best players know that they usually can not (and need not) control all aspects of the game. The best players must also make play decisions to avoid becoming the threat, often called &#8220;The Archenemy,&#8221; and thus the target of the other players at the table.  Many other EDH writers, including the pioneer of the format, Sheldon Menery, have discussed the theory of always being &#8220;<a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/print.php?Article=26483">second best</a>&#8221; in an EDH game. By doing this, a player can avoid becoming &#8220;The Archenemy,&#8221; maintain a strong enough position to resist attack and eventually dethrone &#8220;The Archenemy&#8221; and take the game in a most epic fashion!</p>
<p><b>The Beginning Stage</b></p>
<p>In the beginning of the game, all resources are equal.  (Lets say for the sake of argument that &#8212;most people&#8212; you play against won&#8217;t have extremely broken and monetarily expensive &#8220;potential resources&#8221; in their deck.  This factor does play a role in how the pod may play out, but I’m not going to discuss this, as this factor will always be largely out of your control when you play EDH at your local shop with random opponents.)</p>
<p>The first piece of threat assessment information presented to us in the beginning stage is when the commanders are turned face up at the start of a game.   Certain commanders are inherently more threatening than others.  Fast: (CMC &lt; 3), Aggressive: (Xenegos God of Revels), &#8220;toolbox&#8221; (Zur the Enchanter, Captain Sisay) and &#8220;over the top&#8221; (Maelstrom Wanderer, Kozilek) tend to draw attention, as most players have felt their wrath at some point and may harbor hate toward those generals..  Colors also signal what potential threats may appear in a deck.  A basic understanding of <a href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Color_Pie">Magic&#8217;s color pie</a> is helpful.</p>
<p>The best play in this stage is a good partial Paris mulligan into a hand with 2-3 land and a few low-cost permanents, and a reasonable (as opposed to ridiculous) start.  Many players attempt to start strong with &#8220;fast mana&#8221; in the form of Sol Ring, Moxes, and mana elves, or perhaps a hand fixer like Scroll Rack, Land Tax and Sensei&#8217;s Divining Top, or even a tutor such as Vampiric or Enlightened.  All of these plays are fine, but one must be aware of the potential pitfalls.   A &#8220;broken mana&#8221; start, sure to put one on the radar, usually looks like: land, Sol Ring, Signet/Talisman.  This almost always signals something disgusting is coming on turns two or three, and will always cause the aggressive focus of the table to shift to that player.  Cards like Sensei&#8217;s Divining Top, fetchlands into dual lands, and tutors tend to put one on the radar just because searching and shuffling constantly can make a turn annoyingly slow.  It&#8217;s also almost always the case that a turn two tutor is looking for one of the aforementioned mana/hand enablers.  Consider the alternative play of just &#8220;basic land go&#8221; or &#8220;tapped land, go&#8221; if you do not have a coherent follow-up plan for that mana, such as a turn-two commander that costs four mana.  One of the saddest times I&#8217;ve ever had in the beginning stage was after I enlightened tutored for Sol Ring on turn one, only to have my opponent cast Codex Shredder and slice my ring directly off the top.  We have since dubbed that play: &#8220;The Circumcision&#8230;&#8221;  I was playing a 3-color general, so the chances of having all three colors on turn two was pretty slim.  I got greedy, and was punished for it.</p>

<p><b>The Building Stage</b></p>
<p>Though many of the &#8220;broken starts&#8221; I just discussed put a player on the radar, they also can put that player in a good position during the building stage.  In this stage it is not uncommon to see the green players cast multiple variations of cultivate or explosive vegetation, or to see blue and white players cast propaganda and rule of law effects to slow the green players down, or two see players try to get an early life total advantage by deploying creatures and drawing &#8220;first blood.&#8221;  There are many aggressive generals in the 1-4 CMC (converted mana cost) range that may enter play and start doing work.  Be aware that overextending in this stage can lead to ruinous consequences such as Armageddon, Wrath of God, Nevinyrral&#8217;s Disk, or worse: the dreaded Cataclysms and Hallowed Burials.  These can set you back pretty far if you are left empty handed.  Many seasoned players wait until after the first board wipe to even consider playing their Generals, unless they are easy to recast or have some insane benefit that comes with being recast (Derevi, Marath, or Skullbriar).</p>
<p>One of Tampa Bay&#8217;s favorite EDH players, Rob Burgess, taught me the following lesson many times with his Mono-White control build of <a href="http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/21-10-14-swc-michael-bay/">Heliod, God of the Sun</a>:</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;Creatures should be considered totally expendable.”</i></b></p>
<p>(Unless they come from God Packs, see below)</p>
<p>He has affectionately named this deck “Michael Bay” because of the sheer number of “blow up the world” effects in the deck.  Board wipes are a threat in all stages of the game.  Enchantments and Artifacts are a bit safer, although Planeswalkers played in this stage will turn your opponents in your direction, so be ready to protect them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rob.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-453 aligncenter" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rob-220x300.jpg" alt="rob" width="220" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rob-220x300.jpg 220w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rob.jpg 704w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /></a></p>

<p><b>The Escalation, and Ending Stages</b></p>
<p>After players rebuild from initial board wipes, and players gain the ability to produce 5-8 mana, the big guns might start to come out.  This is where the game starts to get interesting, and a stalemate/power struggle can develop.  These &#8220;cold wars&#8221; often end in another board wipe, but many decks contain built in “fail-safes” to quickly recover and overwhelm their opponents.  These fail-safes are often the most threatening permanents on the board, and they fall under these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giants played after board wipe: (EX: Any Eldrazi, Consuming Aberration)</li>
<li>Mana Doublers: (EX: Mana Reflection, Mirari’s Wake, Mana Flare)</li>
<li>Graveyard Recursion (EX: Living Death, Open the Vaults, Replenish)</li>
<li>Saviors that negate the wipe: (EX: Ghostway, Rootborn Defenses, Boros Charm)</li>
<li>One-Card Combos (Craterhoof Behemoth, Genesis Wave, Primal Surge, Insurrection)</li>
<li>Infinite 2+ Card Combos (Kiki-Jiki + Pestermite, Purphuros + Storm Herd.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the classic &#8220;question and answer&#8221; stage of a Magic game:  players play something threatening, and test whether or not their opponents have an answer (or any answers left).  Big swarms of creatures, combos, and board locks that go unanswered will lead to the ending stage.  It seems basic because it is.  <b><i>The problem is that in a multiplayer game it is largely impossible to have answers to every problem your opponents challenge you with, and have enough questions to account for all of your opponents answers</i></b>.  In addition, <b><i>Magic has inherent variance</i></b>, which makes it fun due to its replay value, but also frustrating at times. Many beginning players tend to under prepare or over prepare.  The best advice I can give is to play your deck several times, understand its strengths and weaknesses, and make small adjustments as needed to cover the problems you are running into, and use the most efficient answers possible.  I used to completely overhaul my decks after losing, only to find that the deck gets skewed toward answering one particular problem, and loses focus on the big picture.  I call this the state of being &#8220;overbuilt,&#8221; and try my best not to ruin a deck by making too many coarse adjustments where fine adjustments are more practical and reasonable.</p>
<p><b>PART TWO: Threat Assessment and Dealing With Threats</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Who do I attack,</li>
<li>When do I attack?</li>
<li>Why are they attacking me?</li>
<li>Which cards are threatening?</li>
<li>How do I stop them?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are the inspiration for this article.</p>
<p><b><i>Who to attack</i></b>:</p>
<p>Most often the correct answer is to attack the person that you assess is the most threatening at the table.  If it’s you, I advise that you should attack the second most threatening person at the table, and encourage others to do so.  Often I see players go after the person that is the most vulnerable.  It’s understandable to attack the person without blockers if you want to get a Sword of Fire and Ice trigger in, or the person with no creatures if you want to draw cards from Edric Spymaster of Trest.  It makes little sense to damage someone just because they don’t have a blocker.  It tends to put you on the radar for being the “aggressor” or the “bully.”  Don’t be surprised to see the table rushing to “smite the evil one,” or at best, deny you a request to remove an oppressive permanent or help to save you.</p>
<p>At many tables, by contrast, it&#8217;s no big deal to get in a few cheap points of damage when you can, and it is often expected and acceptable to be attacked when vulnerable.  The goal is to kill your opponents, isn&#8217;t it?  Know when it’s appropriate to be cutthroat, and appropriate to go easy and let a game develop (especially with newer players).</p>
<p>One last thing that really annoys me: I often see players rolling a dice to determine who to attack.  What are they really saying?</p>
<p>a.) I can’t decide who is the most threatening.</p>
<p>b.) I believe the randomness of the dice roll absolves me of all “aggressive behavior.” (You dice-roll attacked me with Kozilek, I absolve you of NOTHING!)</p>
<p>c.) I am playing Ruhan of the Fomori (which is not only forgivable, but awesome!)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-461" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/221-210x300.jpg" alt="221" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/221-210x300.jpg 210w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/221.jpg 312w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a></p>
<p><b><i>When to attack</i></b>:</p>
<p>This depends on your deck and your play-style.  Some decks are set up to be aggressive, some are set up to sit back and watch enemies kill each other while staying out of the fray, then swooping in to take down weakened opponents.  Both are viable strategies, but  I&#8217;ve found that decks that just lock opponents down (Stasis) <b><i>without</i></b> providing some way to win quickly can drag out a game in ways that may paint a permanent target on you/your general’s deck.  You ideally want your opponents to attack each other, as opposed to having them do nothing.  <b><i>Many seasoned players have been known to actively try to save their opponents</i></b>, especially if &#8220;The Archenemy&#8221; is too powerful to deal with once another player is dead, and &#8220;The Archenemy&#8221; points their cannons at them.</p>
<p><b>Why are they attacking me?</b></p>
<p>The answer may be one of several reasons:</p>
<p><b>1. You are perceived to be the current threat</b>, likely for playing too aggressively (see above), or playing something very threatening (see the list of &#8220;red alert&#8221; targets below.)</p>
<p><b>2. You are vulnerable</b> (you haven&#8217;t developed a board state that will adequately defend you, you&#8217;ve had a slow start, or they have a fast start.</p>
<p><b><b>3. Red alert targets</b></b></p>
<p>You may be under attack because you played something extremely threatening or broken.  In addition to the theory of being &#8220;second best,&#8221; Sheldon Menery also wrote a continuing series called &#8220;<a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/article/25922_Can-t-Get-Mad-List-4.html">You Can&#8217;t Get Mad</a>.&#8221;  It&#8217;s required reading for any aspiring EDH player.  He writes that there are many cards that are so threatening that no one will really feel sorry for you if they get destroyed…thus there is no point in being mad 🙂</p>
<p>My personal hall of fame/shame.  These are currently “KOS” (kill on sight) for me at all times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prophet of Kruphix/ Seedborn Muse</li>
<li>Any Eldrazi</li>
<li>Doubling season</li>
<li>Mirari&#8217;s wake</li>
<li>Howling Mine variants</li>
<li>Mindslaver</li>
<li>Humility</li>
<li>Purphuros</li>
<li>Oblivion stone</li>
<li>Academy Ruins</li>
<li>Gaea&#8217;s Cradle</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> In-Game revenge</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You might be taking damage because you hit them first, and they are simply retaliating.  It’s the scientific principle of action and reaction.  It often leads to an attrition war, with someone other than the two players fighting emerging as the victor.</p>
<p>Many great empires of history have fallen because of this.  But as Alexander the Great once said: &#8220;YOLO.&#8221;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> You’re the unknown</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Many fear what they don’t understand.  I&#8217;ve experienced aggression because I was one of the people at a table that the attacker didn&#8217;t know.  I sensed that she was a relatively new player, so I get it.  I just tend to attack using threat assessment (the purpose of this article). Inter-game squabbles happen often, and most of the time they get shrugged off and forgotten about after the game.  Occasionally it turns into the next topic&#8230;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><b> Sociopolitical revenge/ collusion</b>: Anyone who has played EDH long enough knows that this game can get political, and that no game exists in a vacuum.  Over time, we learn about those in our playgroup, and often we develop &#8220;friendly&#8221; grudges against certain decks and players.  I know that many players carry a moniker of &#8220;needs to die&#8221; just because they sit down at the table.  Admittedly, I&#8217;m that person from time to time at Wizards Cupboard, and as far as I can tell, it&#8217;s a sign of respect to be attacked early and often when I play certain Generals (Oloro, Brago, Captain Sisay).  Another player that often (and proudly) takes the heat is Phil, AKA &#8220;Kill Phil&#8221; (volumes one AND two).  He has a way of building creative and nasty interactions into his decks, and generally is favored at 51% or better to take down any given pod on any given Tuesday or Thursday.  He usually has a new well-tuned deck each week to keep us guessing, and always has two or three good ideas ready to go.</li>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Rule #1</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>“The Quarterback and the Cheerleader”</i></b></p>
<p><strong><em>COLLUSION:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>noun</em></p>
<p><em>1. a secret agreement, especially for fraudulent or treacherous purposes;conspiracy:</em></p>
<p>My collusion story comes from an early point in My EDH ‘career,’ back when I used to think that playing in EDH tournaments with random people at 5K standard tournaments was a good idea.  I was playing Classic Captain Sisay, a toolbox of legendary creatures and lands for every occasion.  The dream was to assemble the Yosei infinite skip-your-untap step Lock, or the Kamahl/Crovaxx land destroyer.</p>
<p>My opponents were a Reya Dawnbringer angel deck, a Teneb Deck, and a Teysa Orzhov Scion deck.  I knew the Teneb player, as he was the one who gave me the &#8220;questionable trade&#8221; from last article, and the Teysa player was seen in Wizards Cupboard finagling her way behind the counter to buy foils for her deck (George has a soft spot for the ladies!), and the Reya player was someone new.  Teneb started by introducing himself and asking everyone&#8217;s name, and wished us all a good game.   We proceeded to move through the beginning and building stages, and I had a decent start with Captain Sisay on turn 3, which tutored up Rofellos (this was way before his banning) followed by Gaea&#8217;s Cradle on the next two turns.  Teneb had assembled Crucible of Worlds + Strip Mine, which he used to take out the Cradle and a few other lands around the table.  Teysa played a few innocuous enchantments and an Altar of Dementia, and then a threat in Divinity of Pride.  Reya played an Island Sanctuary and then  Luminarch Ascension.  At that, Teneb began clamoring for the table to deal with Luminarch as fast as possible, and started hitting the player with the fliers he could.  I hopped on the bandwagon, fearing a horde of angels, and started pointing the Aura Shards cannon toward Reya&#8217;s enchantments, ignoring the Crucible and Altar that my other opponents were sitting on.  Teysa&#8217;s Divinity of Pride joined in, and soon Reya was eliminated.  Now, it was clear that Teysa was the big threat, and with her sitting at 56 life, she needed to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Then came the blind side.  On Teysa’s end step, Teneb flashed in Vindicate enabled by Vedalken Orrery, sniping my Sisay. In addition he end-of turn Strip Mined my Kor Haven.  On his turn he followed up with a Yawgmoth&#8217;s Will to recast Vindicate on Rofellos and to Strip Mine another land.  I was pretty crippled at this point, which allowed Teysa to complete her altar of Dementia/Darkest Hour/Cloudgoat Ranger Combo (this makes infinite sacrificial tokens, generating infinite mill from the altar).</p>
<p>Teysa and Teneb were in collusion all along.  He was merely buying time for her to assemble the combo.  They collected and split the $20 prize, leaving me pretty stupefied.  Karma probably got the better of him though&#8230; Later he was showing off a Black Lotus he traded for at the convention, claiming that he got a great deal on because it was &#8220;water damaged.&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t have the heart to tell him that it was a &#8220;<a href="http://www.apathyhouse.com/fake/page322.php">Rebacked</a>&#8221; Collectors Edition version, and was as fake as the handshake and well wishes he gave to us at the start of our pod.</p>

<li><b> Chaos Theorists/ Anarchists</b></li>
</ol>
<p>These are the wide-eyed maniacs that like to play Nekusar and Teferi&#8217;s Puzzle Box, or randomly &#8220;karate chop&#8221; creatures at people after rolling a dice without explanation.  The point is, sometimes people do random and unpredictable things, and this may actually be a part of a grand strategic plan to keep us guessing, or they&#8217;re just having fun.  I can&#8217;t really judge them, and occasionally it&#8217;s fun to play the role of the “Jester” or “Troll.”  This is how I explain Rakdos decks that warp world into Ankh of Mishra, or Phelddagrif decks that play Knowledge Pool and Hive Mind, with a side Eye of the Storm.</p>

<p><b>How can I attempt to stop them?</b></p>
<p>A comprehensive study of removal in EDH could be an entire article in itself (and may be someday soon!!)  If its possible in your color identity, try to have at least one card to address each of the following aspects of the game.  Some common answers follow in each category:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dangerous Graveyard</b>: Suggested color: Black/Artifact/Green:Top Answers: Tormod&#8217;s Crypt, Relic of Progenitus, Withered Wretch, Bojuka Bog, Loaming Shaman, Scavenging ooze, Rest in Peace, leyline of the void.</li>
<li><b>Dangerous Enchantments</b>: Green/White: Aura Shards, Krosan Grip, Acidic Slime, Return to Dust, Austere Command, Act of Authority</li>
<li><b>Dangerous Artifacts</b> Green, Red, White, Blue: Many of the Enchantment hosers also hit artifacts.  Vandalblast and Hurkyl&#8217;s Recall are really efficient answers in Blue and Red.</li>
<li><b>Dangerous Creatures</b>: White, Black, Blue, Red, Artifact, Land.  They truly are the most expendable things in the game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>An aside on creature removal</b><i>: &#8211;Generally speaking&#8211; (even though this article is about “situational” awareness)</i>, effects that remove creatures are most powerful in this order: Bottomdeck/Shuffle in &gt; Exile &gt; Destroy(no regen) &gt; Destroy &gt; Permanent Gain Control &gt; Temporary Gain Control &gt; Put on top of owner’s library &gt; Return to owner&#8217;s hand &gt; prevent combat damage = effective blocking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Millstone Effects</b>: Kozilek and Ulamog, Elixir of Immortality, Feldon&#8217;s Cane, Mistveil Plains, Volrath&#8217;s Stronghold</li>
<li><b>Resource Abundance</b>: Armageddon, Land equilibrium, cataclysm, vorinclex</li>
<li><b>Card Drawing</b>: Jin Gitaxias, Sadistic Hypnotist, Syphon Mind, ill-gotten Gains, Molten Psyche, Underworld Dreams.</li>
<li><b>Counterspells</b>: Wheel of Fortune, Teferi&#8217;s Puzzle Box, Windfall.</li>
<li><b>Enter the Battlefield abilities</b>: Torpor Orb, Humility</li>
<li><b>Activated Abilities</b>:  Null Rod, Linvala Keeper of SIlence</li>
</ul>
<p>Always Look for two-for-ones (or better), reusable effects.  &#8220;destroy all&#8221; effects, Decimate, Return to Dust, Act of Authority, Wrecking ball, Attrition, Maze of Ith, Reusable fog effects such as Spike Weaver or Constant Mists, Sudden Spoiling/Polymorphist’s Jest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/287.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-463" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/287-210x300.jpg" alt="287" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/287-210x300.jpg 210w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/287.jpg 312w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>On Counterspells</strong>:  You may have noticed a lack of counter magic in any of my “answer” lists.  The reason is that counters in EDH are largely one-for-one answers, thus inefficient when trying to deal with three different opponents.  I spoke about this in my Oloro Esper Control article, and tried to convey the idea that unless you are protecting a very valuable board state, counters are often not the correct answers; instead one should board wipe.</p>
<p><b>When considering when to play a board wipe</b> in the game, be sure to consider if it&#8217;s really that necessary.   Ask yourself whether or not you could gain more value waiting a turn or two.   Certain cards are threatening, but often they need not be answered immediately.  The absence of an &#8220;expected&#8221; board wipe may send the signal to your opponents that the way is clear, and cause them to overplay their hands.  In this situation you can really punish them and accrue more card advantage for your investment.  There is, of course, the possibility that your opponents will be able to recover quickly, or the wipe will be too late, but with experience you&#8217;ll get better at understanding the right timing for your answers.</p>
<p><b>Closing and Commenting</b></p>
<p>Since we’re approaching a “ten page term paper” in length, I’m going to end it here.  I hope this isn&#8217;t the last word about Threat Assessment, and I encourage any readers to comment and make suggestions below.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I realize that mistakes are part of learning, and when it comes to Threat Assessment, MTG writing, or any aspect of the game you’d like to discuss, I’m always willing to listen.  Until then, See you in the pods at the Wizard’s Cupboard!</p>
