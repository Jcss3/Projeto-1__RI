<h2>Banned</h2>
<p>The January 9th Banned and Restricted changes for Standard</p>
</address>
<address>
<ul>
<li>Smuggler&#8217;s Copter is banned</li>
<li>Emrakul, the Promised End is banned</li>
<li>Reflector Mage is banned</li>
</ul>
<p>First off, I dislike these bans.  However, I grudgingly understand the logic that brought us to this point.</p>
<p>Emrakul, the Promised End probably needed to go.  It was a little too powerful, fit into any deck by nature of being colorless, required onerous tracking of graveyards, and did not result in fun games.  That&#8217;s a long list of reasons why that card probably should probably take a hike.  Emrakul, the Promised End had a pretty firm stranglehold on the late game in Standard.</p>
<p>Things get a little less enjoyable from there.  Smuggler&#8217;s Copter was banned due to its inclusion in all of the aggressive decks in Standard.  However, Smuggler&#8217;s Copter had pretty much been reduced to the various vehicle decks that were considered a tier under the Aetherworks Marvel and delirium decks.  The colorless nature of Smuggler&#8217;s Copter and its ubiquitous inclusion in all the initial aggressive decks flagged it as a concern for Wizards of the Coast.  Banning cards causes a loss of faith in players, so Wizards of the Coast limits them as much as possible.  Banning one card, only to have another colorless threat dominate the tournament scene would have looked terrible, so Smuggler&#8217;s Copter got the axe.</p>
<p>Lastly, they took a look at Reflector Mage.  Reflector Mage has featured prominently in several powerful decks in Standard since it was printed.  Collected Company was the biggest offender, but the powerful Man-o-War showed up again in the U/W Flash deck for this season of Standard.  This was a card that was pushed for Limited play, and Wizards of the Coast never expected it to see play in Standard.  The nature of the bounce effect is obnoxious to remember, and its history of dominating tournaments made Wizards of the Coast nervous enough to add it to the list.  Once again, this feels like it was a preemptive ban to avoid the need to revisit the subject in the near future.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what to think of Felidar Guardian.  I do lean towards the opinion that it and Saheeil Rai will heavily influence Standard in the coming months.  I expect the announcement that the Banned and Restricted list will have a Standard update five weeks after the Pro Tour to address Felidar Guardian.  However, that logic flies in the face of my logic for the Smuggler’s Copter and Reflector Mage ban.  I suppose we will see the PT results and WotC’s reaction soon.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who played through the banning of Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Stoneforge Mystic, these cards don’t feel as oppressive.  Except for possibly Emrakul, the Promised end.  I do feel like the lack of tournaments over the holidays gave players longer than normal to gripe about Emrakul and Aetherworks Marvel.  The biggest names in the game wrote about how oppressive these cards were, instead of brewing up answers to take to nonexistent tournaments.  I also feel like Aether Revolt contained some answers for some of the bigger problems.</p>
<p>These bans will have as big an effect on Standard as the new cards being introduced to the set.  Most small sets have a few cards that might generate a new deck.  Most other cards are duds or simply slot into existing decks.  This set will be different.  All of the major decks in Standard are either going to radically shift or simply won&#8217;t exist anymore.  That makes it harder to evaluate cards based on the format, since we don&#8217;t have a format to work from.</p>

<h2>Aether Revolt Rare and Mythic Rare Review</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AethergeodeMiner.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1527" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AethergeodeMiner-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AethergeodeMiner-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AethergeodeMiner.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></address>
<address> </address>
<address>White hasn’t really been in the energy game in Kaladesh, so Aethergeode Miner is hoping for Aether Revolt support.  On its own, Aethergeode Miner is a good attacker that can pull herself out of combat.  If you ever wind up with a surplus of energy, like the times that Aethergeode Miner isn’t blocked, spot removal is essentially invalidated.  She also does a good job crewing Heart of Kiran and is a decent enabler to trigger revolt.  That looks like a good deal.She just has to compete with Selfless Spirit, Veteran Motorist, and Scrapheap Scrounger for a spot in decks.  Those are all two drops with tournament success backing them.  If Aethergeode Miner can’t edge one of those out, she will be hoping for an energy deck that dips into white.</address>

<address>This vehicle seems a little disjointed to me.  The power and toughness ratio encourage defense over offense, and the lifelink promotes a longer game.  On the other hand, vehicles in general synergize with aggressive decks, and the crew cost of one screams for an aggressive deck.  Lastly, it drains energy.  The current crop of energy producers are in red and green.  Most of the energy creatures already have 2-3 power, so crewing this vehicle is only a marginal benefit.  With Smuggler&#8217;s Copter out of the picture, not all hope is lost for Aethersphere Harvester.  It will probably end up competing with Fleetwheel Cruiser for flex spots or wait in the sideboard aggressive mirrors.One other note is the mana cost at three.  With the glut of good options at three mana, Aethersphere Harvester has a rough path to playability.</address>

<address>If you need infinite energy and have infinite mana, this is the card for you.  It&#8217;ll also be worth nothing, because nobody needs infinite energy if they have infinite mana.  Bulk rare</address>

<address> </address>
<address>This produces a lot of energy in the right deck, but decks that need lots of energy rarely have a lot of creatures in play and a realistic ability to cast seven mana cards.  This looks like a bulk mythic unless energy decks move in a different direction. </address>

<address> </address>
<address>Aid from the Cowl can cheat on mana costs, so it deserves a close look.  This biggest test will be the reliability of triggering revolt without spending mana.  If Aid from the Cowl can’t trigger immediately and takes the entirety of turn five, it is probably too slow.  If you can reliably trigger it every turn, starting with turn five, it could be worth the effort.  It might work as a backup for Aetherworks Marvel even if there aren’t methods to trigger revolt reliably.  Aetherworks Marvel did just lose its best target, so I&#8217;m not sure how much of a chance Aid from the Cowl has. </address>

<address><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AjaniUnyielding.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1532" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AjaniUnyielding-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AjaniUnyielding-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AjaniUnyielding.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a>Ajani feels a little disjointed to me.  Selenya usually promotes aggressive strategies, and Ajani Unyielding is firmly a control card.  He would have done a servicable job against Emrakul, the Promised End, but that isn&#8217;t an issue anymore.  Now he will be competing with Sorin, Grim Nemesis for a spot in decks.  Let&#8217;s go over the abilities.</p>
<p>The plus two ability draws all nonland permanents from the top three cards of your deck.  Not picking up instants and sorceries is a deck constraint, but not a particularly burdensome one in Selesnya.  Vehicles and planeswalkers will pick up most of the non-creature slots for Ajani Unyielding decks, so a deck should have few misses beyond lands.  The plus two ability should draw approximately 1.5 spells, which is significantly better than one card and probably better than two cards.  Ajani should do a good job of reloading your hand with action if your deck is constructed properly.  Stasis Snare even allows Ajani to hit removal beyond additional copies of himself.</p>
<p>The minus two ability is the spell Swords to Plowshares.  If your deck is casting six mana planeswalkers, giving your opponent life is a very small cost for unrestricted creature removal.  Ajani also counts as a removal spell that is still a hit for the plus two ability, so multiple copies synergize well together.  As far as defensive abilities go, Ajani rates pretty highly.  Simply killing a creature and not giving the opponent life might be a little better, but there are multiple benefits to using Ajani over something like Ob Nixilis Reignited.  The biggest is that Ajani Unyielding can use the minus ability twice in a row.  You lose him for the second use, but more options will always be a benefit.  Secondly, Ajani Unyielding exiles instead of killing creatures.  Liliana, the Last Hope and Grapple with the Past have filled Standard with more Raise Dead effects than ever before.  Killing something and knowing it will stay gone is a real bonus.</p>
<p>Lastly, Ajani’s ultimate ability adds five +1/+1 counters to all of your creatures and five loyalty counters to all of your other planeswalkers.  I’m a little less thrilled with this ability, since it is not a guaranteed kill.  If you don’t have a developed board, it could easily not do anything at all.  It does synergize with his plus two ability, since you would theoretically spend the previous three turns drawing spells.  It is not the same kind of ultimate as Chandra, Torch of Defiance or Ob Nixilis Reignited, which will win the game outright.  However, it is not a requirement to use the ultimate if you reach it.  Ajani Unyielding can just continue to draw cards and remove creatures until the ultimate becomes relevant.</p>
<p>Ajani does some good things, but the mana cost is going to make him difficult to play.  I don&#8217;t really know if he has the support to succeed, but he provides good utility if your deck can support him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/0892424773.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1526" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/0892424773-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/0892424773-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/0892424773.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the first Expertise card, each of which allows a card cheaper than the spell’s CMC to be cast for free.  This is being compared to the cascade mechanic, but they are notably different.  Cascade spells will always give you value based on the second card.  Each of the Expertise cards are underpowered spells that rely on having other cards in your hand to</p>
<p>On its own, Baral’s Expertise is three sorcery speed unsummons for five mana.  That’s a horrendous deal.  That means that the real power of the spell is going to come from clearing the way for whatever other spell you are casting.  A fair deck could use Baral&#8217;s Expertise to clear the board and resolve a planeswalker to generate a fairly backbreaking play.  However, fair decks are going to suffer the most from the incredibly low floor on Expertise cards.  When you have no hand and draw this card, things probably won’t end well for you.</p>
<p>Unfair decks seem like the way to abuse Baral&#8217;s Expertise.  Some sort of a combo finish that needs a clear board could include this card for a minimal cost.  If the combo is the main win condition, Baral&#8217;s Expertise comes at a pretty low cost.  This seems like the best home for a card like Baral&#8217;s Expertise.</p>
<p>Modern also offers some bonuses with the Expertise cards.  Living End, Restore Balance, Wheel of Fate, and any of the other cards that don&#8217;t have a mana cost can be cast off of the Expertise cards.  Beck//Call, Breaking//Entering, Catch//Release, and other fuse cards can have both sides cast in conjunction with the Expertise cards.  Baral&#8217;s Expertise should stay above bulk prices for those abilities alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BaralChiefOfCompliance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1533" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BaralChiefOfCompliance-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BaralChiefOfCompliance-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BaralChiefOfCompliance.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>We can stop after the first ability and confidently say that Baral will see play in Constructed magic.  Goblin Electromancer has a harder mana cost and it still shows up in Modern storm decks.  Standard has some combo pieces that could really use a cost reduction, with Paradoxical Outcome from Kaladesh leading the pack.  The legendary status will pose a slight problem, making it impossible to stack the ability.</p>
<p>Attaching a free loot to your counter spells is a sweet bonus.  That shouldn&#8217;t be the big draw to including Baral in your deck, but bonus abilities are never something to scoff at.  Fragile cost reductions are usually worse in fair decks, and Baral doesn&#8217;t offer anything more than card selection as a bonus.  A single copy might not be out of the question, but I wouldn&#8217;t load your deck up with a full set of Baral, Chief of Compliance without a plan for a spell-based combo finish.</p>
<p>I expect Baral, Chief of Compliance to be a moderately important cog in some combo decks.  Time will tell if those combo decks will ever amount to anything.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BattleAtTheBridge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1534" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BattleAtTheBridge-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BattleAtTheBridge-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BattleAtTheBridge.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Any ability that allows players to cheat on mana is noteworthy, and improvise has a lot of comparisons to Affinity.  Tapping the artifacts means that creatures will only count if you are willing to skip the attack step.  More noteworthy is that the tap requirement prevents chaining multiple improvise spells together on a single turn.  Even with all of the downgrades on Affinity, the cost reduction for improvise spells will still be worth a close examination of each one.</p>
<p>Battle at the Bridge will likely end up as a role player removal spell for an artifact heavy deck.  I would expect to see Battle at the Bridge in small numbers, since it will likely compete with other improvise spells for the use of artifacts.  Murderous Cut in decks with Dig Through Time is a good example.  Enough fuel was used for Dig Through Time that Murderous Cut was a singleton or maybe two at most.</p>
<p>In Modern, Affinity won’t be interested in tapping down so many artifacts for this kind of effect.  Galvanic Blast is a more efficient use of that card slot.  A slower deck like Lantern Control or a Sword of the Meek/Thopter Foundry deck will be much more interested.  The life gain will matter more and tapping artifacts will be less of a restriction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CallForUnity.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1535" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CallForUnity-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CallForUnity-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CallForUnity.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Call for Unity is expensive and situational.  If you really need an anthem effect for a token deck, this might be a place to look.  Always Watching or Oath of Ajani are almost always going to be better options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ConsulateCrackdown.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1536" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ConsulateCrackdown-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ConsulateCrackdown-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ConsulateCrackdown.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the Creeping Corrosion safety valve for Aether Revolt.  If a heavy artifact deck becomes too popular, Consulate Crackdown is available to handle it.  Otherwise, this is a worse version of Quarantine Field and should be avoided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DarkIntimations.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1537" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DarkIntimations-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DarkIntimations-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DarkIntimations.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the Eye of Ugin plant for the next block.  Presumably, Nicol Bolas will return and give us a card that cares about the second ability.  Otherwise, this is a cute callback to Cruel Ultimatum that is a little too slow for Standard.  Torrential Gearhulk can’t even recur it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disallow.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1538" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disallow-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disallow-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disallow.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>If you want a three mana counter for your deck, this is the best option.  Countering abilities is an important answer to planeswalker ultimates and has a lot of niche uses like Evolving Wilds, crewing vehicles, and stopping zombies from Kalitas.  Disallow does not exile spells, so Liliana, the Last Hope might still necessitate the occasional Void Shatter.  Otherwise, Disallow will be the clear choice for counter magic in Standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ExquisiteArchangel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1539" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ExquisiteArchangel-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ExquisiteArchangel-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ExquisiteArchangel.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>The set and the flavor text really make me believe that Exquisite Archangel should have been an artifact.  As it stands, this is a pretty unique ability that is difficult to evaluate.  My inclination is that it is cute, but not really useful.  An opponent will just make sure to handle it before dealing lethal damage.  There might be some kind of combo that Exquisite Archangel facilitates, but there are more exciting things to cheat into play normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FreejamRegent.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1540" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FreejamRegent-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FreejamRegent-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FreejamRegent.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This looks like a Limited bomb that won&#8217;t see any other play.  Decks full of artifacts aren&#8217;t looking for 4/4 dragons as a payoff card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GlintSleeveSiphoner.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1541" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GlintSleeveSiphoner-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GlintSleeveSiphoner-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GlintSleeveSiphoner.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Like Aethergeode Miner, Glint-Sleeve Siphoner is hoping for an energy deck that doesn&#8217;t currently exist.  This is one of the better Dark Confidant variants that Wizards of the Coast has printed, but I don&#8217;t think it will be good enough without additional energy generators.  This is one of the better sinks for energy, provided those decks are willing to touch black cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GontisAetherHeart.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1542" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GontisAetherHeart-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GontisAetherHeart-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GontisAetherHeart.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This will compete with Era of Innovation for energy generation.  Gonti&#8217;s Aether Heart works in a non-blue deck, and it is also a free trigger if you are willing to wait to cast a six mana spell.  It is also a cheaper investment overall if you plan to trigger it more than four times.  You should be able to decide which card is better for your specific deck.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for the extra turn, Gonti&#8217;s Aether Heart isn&#8217;t the greatest payoff for energy.  Eight energy and six mana for an extra turn is a large cost.  It is nice that any color can play this, but that is part of the reason for the expensive cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenbeltRampager.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1543" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenbeltRampager-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenbeltRampager-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenbeltRampager.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This looks like a fantastic addition to the aggressive energy deck from early in Kaladesh Standard.  With Smuggler&#8217;s Copter hitting the bench, energy could easily be the aggressive deck of the format.  Greenblet Rampager gives the deck another play on turn one that generates energy.  Later on, this is a one mana 3/4, which is clearly above the curve.</p>
<p>Greenblet Rampager does some work in other decks too.  The bounce will trigger revolt if you can&#8217;t pay the energy, and Greenblet Rampager can crew vehicles before it is returned to your hand.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Greenbelt Rampager&#8217;s trigger is not optional.  If you have two energy and cast it, you must spend the energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenwheelLiberator.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1544" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenwheelLiberator-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenwheelLiberator-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GreenwheelLiberator.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>The playability of this card is directly influenced by how easy it is to trigger revolt.  If you can set something up on turn one, a 4/3 creature on turn two is a great payoff.  Unfortunately, that is difficult to set up in Standard.  If it takes longer than a turn or so to set up, Greenwheel Liberator won&#8217;t present the same dominating force on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Greenwheel Liberator is large enough in Modern that it might be a contender.  Lightning Bolt is a problem, but it is completely reasonable that stock in Lightning Bolt goes down with the printing of Fatal Push.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HeartOfKiran.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1545" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HeartOfKiran-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HeartOfKiran-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HeartOfKiran.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>There are a few potential homes for Heart of Kiran.  The first is simply slotting it into the old vehicle shell in place of Smuggler&#8217;s Copter.  Heart of Kiran hits harder, but the crew cost to power ratio is actually worse than Smuggler’s Copter.  The legendary card type and the loss of the triggered ability makes this an overall downgrade, but Heart of Kiran should be serviceable.</p>
<p>The best homes for Heart of Kiran will be in decks that can use the planeswalker activation ability.  Heart of Kiran provides excellent protection for planeswalkers, and vigilance allows for some solid attacks to boot.  If you are looking at some kind of planeswalker control deck, a few copies of Heart of Kiran would be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Like Freejam Regent, Herald of Anguish looks to be a relatively poor payoff card for improvise.  Mythic rarity does come with some perks, as this demon comes with a solid end-of-turn trigger.  He also provides a sacrifice outlet for artifacts, but it requires some mana and a target.  I don&#8217;t immediately see a lot of use for Herald of Anguish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is quite the combat trick.  Hexproof is only marginally relevant for indestructible permanents, but there are a few exile effects in Standard.  This might have some fringe sideboard uses if Fumigate makes a resurgance.  If Yahenni&#8217;s Expertise takes off in popularity, Heroic Intervention is going to look quite bad.  Overall, this kind of effect is usually around three mana and relegated to Limited play.  The mana discount likely bumped up the rarity, and the rarity will encourage people to try it in Standard.  I don&#8217;t think this will make a big impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HopeOfGhirapur.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1548" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HopeOfGhirapur-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HopeOfGhirapur-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HopeOfGhirapur.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>I honestly dislike that this kind of card exists in Standard.  There are a few good combo options available in Standard, and cards that reduce interaction will make for less enjoyable games.  If you are playing a combo deck, this is a good option for sideboard.  If you rely on artifacts or have problems with counter spells, this could easily belong in your main deck.  Just watch out for Liliana, the Last Hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IndomitableCreativity.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1549" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IndomitableCreativity-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IndomitableCreativity-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IndomitableCreativity.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really sure where to start with this card.  In a pinch, you can use it for creature or artifact removal.  If your opponent has some kind of combo that relies on a specific creature, this is a red answer for any creature.  Red has better options for handling artifacts.</p>
<p>Realistically, you should be putting this card in your own deck for some kind of combo.  Polymorph gives us a good example of the correct shell.  White has some cards like Servo Exhibition to generate fodder for Indomitable Creativity, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger makes for a pretty good target.  There are plenty of planeswalkers, instants, and sorceries to fill out the deck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/InspiringStatuary.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1550" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/InspiringStatuary-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/InspiringStatuary-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/InspiringStatuary.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>There is some combo potential here.  Giving Paradoxical Outcome improvise seems like a great way to draw a bunch of cards for a single mana.  Inspiring Statuary has really grown on me once I started comparing it to Manalith with upside.  At worst, it is a three cost mana rock, and it has the potential for much more.  It isn’t efficient enough for decks low on artifacts, but the sky is the limit for decks built to abuse Inspiring Statuary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevsExpertise.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1551" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevsExpertise-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevsExpertise-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevsExpertise.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is Hijack with the Expertise clause.  Hijack wasn&#8217;t showing up in Standard before, so the Expertise clause will have to carry some weight.</p>
<p>This is the cheapest Expertise card in the cycle.  It only casts cards that cost two or less, but the cheap cost makes it more likely to have cards in hand to get the benefit.  That means the floor is a little higher than it would normally be.  On the other hand, Kari Zev&#8217;s Expertise requires a target.  That makes it the least reliable card in the cycle.</p>
<p>If you need to cheat a card out in Modern, Kari Zev&#8217;s Expertise is the place to look first.  The benefit here is entirely because of the mana cost.  Just make sure your opponent is likely to have targets to Threaten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevSkyshipRaider.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1552" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevSkyshipRaider-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevSkyshipRaider-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/KariZevSkyshipRaider.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>How is the legendary pirate unable to crew big ships?  What a huge flavor fail.  I suppose it’s less egregious if you consider the monkey token would be doing most of the driving anyway.</p>
<p>Kari Zev, Skyship Raider attacks as a 3/4 creature spread across two bodies.  First strike and menace are strange keywords to have on a 1/3 creature, but they do offer marginal upside.  Most of the aggressive cards in the format either trade with a 2/1 creature or die to a 1/3 first strike creature.  Trading with Kari Zev, Skyship Raider will be difficult for the first few turns, allowing her to get in for a chunk of damage.  If you don&#8217;t have a heavy vehicle theme in your aggressive red deck, Kari Zev is a solid inclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LifecraftersBestiary.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1553" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LifecraftersBestiary-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LifecraftersBestiary-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LifecraftersBestiary.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>We get another combo enabler.  Scry 1 each turn is a nice bonus over the long term, and any deck can utilize that ability.  However, that doesn&#8217;t justify a three mana spell on its own.</p>
<p>Adding a green mana to make every creature Elvish Visionary is a bigger bonus.  Standard is a little light on Elvish Mystics, but there might still be something.</p>
<p>Modern Elves is a lot more interested in this kind of effect.  Glimpse of Nature is banned, but Heritage Druid can still go crazy with Lifecrafter&#8217;s Bestiary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LightningRunner.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1554" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LightningRunner-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LightningRunner-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LightningRunner.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Lightning Runner seems like a decent backup card to Electrostatic Pummler.  Double Strike makes it another good target for Larger than Life and any other pump spells in the deck.  Lightning Runner also generates energy and gives a good sink if your deck has an abundance.  Getting to swing with your double strike creature twice is a good benefit for a deck full of pump spells.</p>
<p>Other energy decks are probably less interested in this as a finisher.  Chandra, Torch of Defiance already does a lot of work in that deck, and she costs a mana less.  There might be some surprise value as a singleton or metagame call, and this gets in for four (or eight) on an empty board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MechanizedProduction.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1555" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MechanizedProduction-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MechanizedProduction-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MechanizedProduction.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This first half of Mechanized Production is Followed Footsteps for artifacts.  There is a slight mana discount, but that isn’t the big draw to the card.  Anything with the text “Win the game” should make you sit up and pay attention.</p>
<p>Mechanized Production only cares about you having eight artifacts with the same name.  That means you can enchant something useful and try to spit out a bunch of tokens to win the game.  Tokens are a much more reliable route to victory, since you don’t have to wait seven turns or dig through your deck to find additional copies.</p>
<p>Clues should be the easiest tokens to generate in Standard.  Thraben Inspector and Tireless Tracker already see play, and there was a fringe deck last season that won with Ghirapur Aether Grid and clue tokens.  If that isn’t appealing to you, servo tokens are probably the next best bet.  Several fabricate cards in Kaladesh are close to playable, and a good payoff card might be enough on its own.</p>
<p>Lastly, don’t forget that Second Harvest can double your tokens for a quick victory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MerchantsDockhand.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1556" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MerchantsDockhand-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MerchantsDockhand-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MerchantsDockhand.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>I suppose Merchant’s Dockhand is an option if you really need to go digging for a combo piece in a heavy artifact deck, but it has a lot of problems.  It is a small creature, so it is vulnerable to most removal spells.  The activated ability is expensive and requires a bunch of artifacts to boot.  I suppose this could be some kind of backup option to find a copy of Aetherflux Reservoir, but that seems really unlikely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MetallicMimic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1557" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MetallicMimic-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MetallicMimic-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MetallicMimic.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>There are a few tribes in Standard that could use a lord, and Metallic Mimic can fill that spot nicely.  Unlike traditional lords, Metallic Mimic needs to be in play before you cast your other creatures, or you won’t get a bonus.  That makes it an improvement for the eldrazi tribe with their expensive mana costs.  Humans, Vampires, and Zombies might be a little less interested, since they could already deploy efficient threats at two mana.</p>
<p>Metallic Mimic also gives out +1/+1 counters instead of a static buff.  That means that you won’t lose the benefit if Metallic Mimic is killed.  Rishkar, Peema Renegade strikes me as a good creature to highlight a +1/+1 counter deck.</p>
<p>Animation Module combos with Metallic Mimic to make any number of 2/2 Servo tokens for one mana each.  The only drawback is you need to generate a counter somewhere else first, so I’m not sure exactly where that combo belongs.  It, like most of the other Aether Revolt combos, is weak to Shock.  However, it might be the value engine that some deck needs.</p>
<p>Metallic Mimic will likely end up as a moderately strong playable in several Standard decks.  This kind of card ends up being worth money a few years down the road, as casual players look for additional lords for their tribal decks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MidnightEntourage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1558" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MidnightEntourage-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MidnightEntourage-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MidnightEntourage.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking of lords, here is one for the aetherborn tribe.  Both abilities are quite good, but I don’t think there are nearly enough strong aetherborn creatures to find Midnight Entourage a home.  Gonti, Lord of Luxury already gives better value for a four cost card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/OathOfAjani.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1559" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/OathOfAjani-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/OathOfAjani-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/OathOfAjani.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>To get the most out of Oath of Ajani, you really need to be getting use from both abilities.  The +1/+1 counter ability encourages a swarm or token strategy.  Tokens gain an extra bonus, as Always Watching did not work in that deck before.  The ramp ability is beneficial for planeswalkers, so you really need a decent suite of them in the deck.  That certainly seems like a clear inclusion for a Selesnya token deck.</p>
<p>If you are running Oath of Ajani for only one of the abilities, you should compare it to Servant of the Conduit or Always Watching.  Make sure this is actually the card you want before you put it in your deck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ParadoxEngine.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1560" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ParadoxEngine-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ParadoxEngine-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ParadoxEngine.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Like several other artifacts in the Kaladesh block, Paradox Engine screams combo potential.  There aren’t a ton of creatures that generate mana in Standard, but Rishkar, Peema Renegade looks like a good place to start.  Modern has a lot more potential, as Heritage Druid and friends should be able to really abuse this kind of trigger.</p>
<p>I feel bad that I don’t have more to offer here.  I’m sure there will be some crazy decks highlighting Paradox Engine, but I don’t really know where to start.  Heritage Druid seems obvious, but I’m sure that just barely scratches the surface.  Maybe something like Rishkar, Peema Renegade, Verdurous Gearhulk and something crazy expensive like Planar Bridge or Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger for Standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PeacewalkerColossus.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1561" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PeacewalkerColossus-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PeacewalkerColossus-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PeacewalkerColossus.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>The crew cost on Peacewalker Colossus is prohibitively high, likely requiring multiple creatures.  That makes this a lot closer to a three mana artifact that lets you crew other vehicles for two mana.  Once you don’t plan on crewing it, Peacewalker Colossus starts to look like a really bad deal.  The numbers on this card just don’t quite work out.  Maybe you just want to fire up some Consulate Dreadnoughts on the cheap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PiasRevolution.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1562" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PiasRevolution-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PiasRevolution-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PiasRevolution.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a punisher card, and those will always work out worse than you want.  For three mana and a card, you give the opponent the choice of casting Raise Dead for artifacts or getting hit with a Lava Spike.  I’m not thinking of a cheap sacrifice outlet for artifacts, or this might have a home in the Aetherflux Reservoir deck.  As it stands, it will probably be relegated to various Commander combos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PlanarBridge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1563" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PlanarBridge-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PlanarBridge-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PlanarBridge.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Fourteen mana to get any permanent from your deck into play is a huge investment.  That makes Planar Portal suitable for only a small subset of decks.  Dedicated ramp decks might use this with some silver bullets, particularly now that Emrakul, the Promised End is gone.  A combo deck might use Planar Bridge, but I’m not even sure where to begin on that one.  Lastly, I suppose this makes a good trump card for control mirrors.  If this resolves, I don’t see how an opponent would beat a new planeswalker every turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithRebel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1564" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithRebel-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithRebel-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithRebel.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This might be a good win condition for Paradox Engine, but I’m not exactly sure how you would go about triggering the Engine consistently.  I expect Quicksmith Rebel to wind up as a bulk rare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithSpy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1565" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithSpy-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithSpy-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/QuicksmithSpy.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Drawing cards is something I would certainly rate higher than a Shock, but I expect Quicksmith Spy to have even less combo potential than Quicksmith Rebel.  I expect them to sit side-by-side in bulk piles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ReleaseTheGremlins.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1566" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ReleaseTheGremlins-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ReleaseTheGremlins-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ReleaseTheGremlins.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a Manic Vandal that can scale if you need to destroy multiple artifacts.  This will be a great sideboard card that might occasionally appear in the starting sixty cards.  It will just depend on what percentage  of decks in the format run artifacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarsExpertise.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1568" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarsExpertise-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarsExpertise-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarsExpertise.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the most expensive Expertise card and likely the worst one of the bunch.  It can draw a bunch of cards, but it is weakened by the opponent’s ability to kill your creature in response your influx of cards.  All of the Expertise cards have some potential, so I wouldn’t completely write it off.  I do expect this one to underperform compared to the other four.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarPeemaRenegade.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1567" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarPeemaRenegade-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarPeemaRenegade-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RishkarPeemaRenegade.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Rishkar, Peema Renegade is part mana accelerant and part lord, buffing both your creatures and your mana production.  Either side of the card is good, with three mana for 4/4 in stats or an extra two mana on turn four.  Beyond that, Rishkar, Peema Renegade does some good work with cards already in Standard.  Verdurous Gearhulk, Metallic Mimic, Nissa, Voice of Zendikar, and Metallic Mimic all generate  +1/+1 counters at a good rate.  I love the idea of a Paradox Engine combo, but there are plenty of reasonable options to consider with that kind of mana production.  Simply putting a counter on Sylvan Advocate and getting into the red zone is a fine place to start.</p>
<p>Just be sure to include enough creatures in your deck.  Rishkar, Peema Renegade loses a ton of potential if you can’t use the second counter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ScrapTrawler.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1569" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ScrapTrawler-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ScrapTrawler-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ScrapTrawler.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>I expect there is some combo potential here, but the inability to loop two copies of this card makes it much harder to find a starting shell.  Still, it is a solid ability for a value aggressive deck, and that might be enough on its own.  Recurring a Walking Ballista, Bomat Courier, or Hope of Ghirapur might be enough for Scrap Trawler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SecretSalvage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1570" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SecretSalvage-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SecretSalvage-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SecretSalvage.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Shadowborn Apostle and Relentless Rats have a new card draw spell.  I suppose you could do something with Hedron Alignment, but I’m already going really deep.  I would avoid this card unless you really want a challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SolemnRecruit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1571" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SolemnRecruit-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SolemnRecruit-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SolemnRecruit.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>I want to compare this card to Mirran Crusader, but that card really thrived on the protection abilities.  Solemn Recruit might be good if you are pursuing a non-human aggressive deck that can trigger Rally consistently.  I expect that Thalia’s Lieutenant will outshine the dwarf tribal deck and keep Solemn Recruit on the bench.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpireOfIndustry.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1572" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpireOfIndustry-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpireOfIndustry-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpireOfIndustry.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This card is great.  I say that about almost every rare land I look at, and Spire of Industry is no different.  It doesn’t matter how strong your cards are if you don’t draw the lands to cast them.  Lands that make multiple colors, even with drawbacks, should always be considered for your deck.  Spire of Industry needs a deck with a reasonable number of artifacts, but Pentad Prism, Cultivator’s Caravan, and Evolving Wilds make adding extra colors to a deck almost trivial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramsExpertise.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1574" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramsExpertise-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramsExpertise-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramsExpertise.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is probably one of the best Expertise cards for a fair deck.  Making three servo tokens is a great deal at two mana and a fantastic deal for a single mana.  The best follow up play is probably Nissa, Voice of Zendikar, since you can generate a huge board advantage for only four mana.</p>
<p>Like all the Expertise cards, the floor is fairly low.  Sram&#8217;s Expertise isn&#8217;t the worst on the surface, but three tokens for four mana is not a good deal.   The same things I have said for the other Expertise cards hold true.  Your deck should have a plan in mind if you are playing this card.</p>
<p>The servo tokens make good targets for Indomitable Creativity if you are looking into that deck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramSeniorEdificer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1573" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramSeniorEdificer-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramSeniorEdificer-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SramSeniorEdificer.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>Puresteel Paladin is back.  Sram, Senior Edificer can fit in one of two kinds of decks.  The first is a hyper aggressive white deck featuring Weapons Trainer and Stone Haven Outfitter.  This is probably a good budget deck, but I&#8217;m skeptical that it could be better than Humans with Thalia&#8217;s Lieutenant.</p>
<p>The other deck, and the one I am much more excited about, is a combo deck that uses Sram, Senior Edificer and cards like Bone Saw and Cathar&#8217;s Shield to draw a large number of cards.  Aetherflux Reservoir looks like the best payoff for this kind of deck.  I don&#8217;t know how good this deck will end up, but it is one of the first things I&#8217;ll be testing with the new cards.</p>
<p>There is some Modern potential here too, combined with Puresteel Paladin.  That deck was mostly a dud before, but Sram, Senior Edificer might change things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TezzeretTheSchemer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1575" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TezzeretTheSchemer-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TezzeretTheSchemer-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TezzeretTheSchemer.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a rather difficult planeswalker to evaluate.  He clearly belongs in a heavy artifact deck, and he will be more of a role player than a linchpin for the deck.  Let’s tackle the abilities one at a time.</p>
<p>The plus ability gives you a Lotus Petal.  This is one of the few opportunities that non-green decks have to get ramp, so that shouldn&#8217;t be discounter.  These also stack, so you can save the etherium cell tokens up for one big turn.  These tokens are also useful for the improvise ability, creating a reusable mana source.</p>
<p>The minus ability is situational creature removal.  This will rely on the number of artifacts your deck can produce that stay on the battlefield.  The plus ability synergizes with this, but planeswalker protection is the most important on the first turn it enters the battlefield.  The +X/-X ability can also be used for a pump effect, but that looks like it will be a corner case instead of the Standard use.</p>
<p>The emblem might actually be the biggest part of Tezzeret the Schemer.  He starts at a fairly impressive five loyalty and only needs to reach seven to ultimate.  That ability is a game breaker against control, consistently turning artifacts into large threats.  I&#8217;m hesitant about relying on the ultimates of planeswalkers in Aether Revolt Standard, as Disallow gives an extra level of protection for control decks.</p>
<p>Looking at everything as a whole, Tezzeret the Schemer looks like a threat specifically for artifact decks.  It is possible that a generic control deck could try him, but the minus and ultimate abilities are pretty lackluster without support.  I expect to see him in small numbers or as a sideboard option against the grindy decks of the format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WalkingBallista.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1576" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WalkingBallista-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WalkingBallista-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WalkingBallista.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This card isn&#8217;t Hangarback Walker.  That said, this is a fairly good rate.  The initial creature will be under the curve, but +1/+1 counters aren&#8217;t that hard to find.  Excess mana turns this into a repetitive source of creature removal or direct damage.  Scrap Trawler can even recur it if you use up all the counters.</p>
<p>I expect this to see a minor to moderate amount of play in Standard.  It makes for a decent road block and scales with the mana you can generate.</p>
<p>This probably won&#8217;t matter too much, but I expect this to replace Triskelion in Vintage Workshop decks.  It also might show up in Affinity decks to give Arcbound Ravager a little extra reach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WhirOfInvention.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1577" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WhirOfInvention-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WhirOfInvention-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WhirOfInvention.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the payoff card I&#8217;m looking for with the improvise mechanic.  Searching your deck for a missing combo piece is a welcome addition for any deck, and this gives the option for a toolbox of silver bullets.  I expect this card to feature prominently for any deck that goes deep on artifacts.</p>
<p>Modern combo decks should consider this card too.  Lotus Bloom seems like the easy target, but the Sword of the Meek/Thopter Foundry combo can push Whir of Invention to find all sorts of crazy cards.</p>
<p>This card has a lot of potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahennisExpertise.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1578" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahennisExpertise-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahennisExpertise-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahennisExpertise.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is probably the easiest candidate for an Expertise card seeing play in Standard.  The sweeper effect is in high demand right now, and -3/-3 should handle most of the aggressive decks.  Liliana, the Last Hope is a great card to get off the Expertise trigger, helping to take out a bigger threat.  If your opponent has a mix of creatures, To the Slaughter should handle whatever Yahenni&#8217;s Expertise can&#8217;t clean up.</p>
<p>Like all expertise cards, the floor is fairly low.  Black doesn&#8217;t have a lot of replacement options, but Flaying Tendrils is worth considering.  It comes at a mana discount and gets the Exile bonus.  If you don&#8217;t need the Expertise trigger and -2/-2 is good enough, you should probably skip Yahenni&#8217;s Expertise.</p>
<p>In Modern, I expect Yahenni&#8217;s Expertise to be the most useful card for Living End and Restore Balance.  Killing things will benefit those decks more than a Threaten effect or generating servo tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahenniUndyingPartisan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1579" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahenniUndyingPartisan-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahenniUndyingPartisan-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/YahenniUndyingPartisan.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a mediocre replacement for Nantuko Husk if you need a free sacrifice outlet in Standard.  She comes with haste and permanently grows if you kill opposing creatures, but sacrificing your own stuff only gives a marginal benefit.  She also dies to her own Expertise card, which is somewhat ironic.  If you really want to make Zulaport Cutthroat work, this might be worth exploring.  I&#8217;m not sure there are enough pieces to make it work, but I wouldn&#8217;t be completely surprised if I was proven wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That covers all of the rare and mythic rare cards in the set.  I just want to draw your attention to a few other things before I call it a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Felidar-Saheeli.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1582" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Felidar-Saheeli-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Felidar-Saheeli-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Felidar-Saheeli.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The Saheeli Rai minus two ability targets Felidar Guardian.  The Felidar Guardian copy enters the battlefield and targets Saheeli Rai.  Saheeli Rai returns with three loyalty and repeats the cycle.</p>
<p>This combo is the real deal.  Shock is good enough to interact with this, but make sure you have a plan.  Aggressive decks probably can’t just race it, and this can win immediately starting on turn six.  Felidar Guardian can flicker a land for an extra mana, so you can’t assume you are safe until turn seven.</p>
<p>Don’t sleep on this one.  Have a plan for this combo.</p>
<p>This is probably the only reason I’m actually happy that Reflector Mage got banned.  Having this target to blink with Felidar Guardian or copy with Saheeli Rai would have been truly unpleasant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Crackdown-Fumarole.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1580" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Crackdown-Fumarole-300x204.png" alt="" width="300" height="204" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Crackdown-Fumarole-300x204.png 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Crackdown-Fumarole.png 457w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Wandering Fumarole activates and can use the power/toughness switching ability any number of times.  Crackdown Construct gains +1/+1 for each activation.</p>
<p>This combo is worse.  Shock still deals with it, but so does any blocker.  The combo takes four mana to activate each time, so it can be planned around with relative ease.  The cost of including this in decks is low, since Wandering Fumarole was already in most of the decks using red and blue.  You don’t really need a specific plan for this, but be aware that it exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FatalPush.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1581" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FatalPush-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FatalPush-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FatalPush.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a></p>
<p>I don’t normally cover uncommon cards, but this is the real deal in Modern.  Believe the hype and expect that format to undergo some changes in the near future.</p>
