<p>The Modern Compendium is reaching the tipping point for the “common” Modern decks. In a large setting, like a Grand Prix, it is statistically reasonable that you would never play any of the decks that are covered today. Or it can be like my last Modern Grand Prix, where I played against Grixis four separate times in seven rounds. Variance is funny like that.  The statistics are useful for identifying what might be popular, but don&#8217;t rely on them too much.  Knowing that four people out of sixteen in your local Modern event play burn should heavily impact your deck choices, but knowing that Burn is 9% of the field at a 2000 person Grand Prix is far less useful.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to change up my formatting for these entries. I didn’t really care for the different sections I had for Overview and Game Plan, and my thoughts tended to overflow from one section into another. From now on, I’m going to just combine them into a single section. I’m also going to go into a little more detail about the different cards in the decks, so the sections will be longer.  I&#8217;m going to drop to four decks instead of five too, since I&#8217;m spending longer on each deck.</p>

<address> </address>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Overview/Game Plan</strong></span></address>
<p>The term Zoo comes from some of the oldest aggressive strategies in Magic. Originally, most of the fast creature decks were filled with cards named after animals one might find in a zoo (like Kird Ape). The name has stuck, and most generic aggressive creature decks are referred to as Zoo.</p>
<p>Zoo is the aggressive deck in almost any matchup. Against no resistance, Zoo should be able to deal 20 damage in about 4-5 turns. Most of the cards in Zoo are customizable, but the basic shell of Zoo consists of Wild Nacatl, Tarmogoyf, Scavenging Ooze, Knight of the Reliquary, and Lightning Bolt. There are some options for the rest of the deck. Utility creatures, such as Quasali Pridemage, Aven Mindcensor, and Gaddock Teeg can pressure the opponent in unexpected ways. Expensive cards like Elspeth, Knight Errant and Siege Rhino can provide raw power in an attempt to overwhelm the grindy decks like Jund and Grixis. Otherwise, the deck can be filled with more cheap creatures, like Kird Ape, and more burn spells to lower the curve and increase the speed of the deck.</p>
<address><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengths</span></strong></address>
<p>The combination of raw speed and power is the biggest strength of Zoo. Opponents interested in taking their time to win can be crushed well before they can establish control. Any misstep with reactive spells not lining up properly against threats will allow the Zoo deck to quickly take the game.</p>
<p>Sideboarding against Zoo is rather difficult, as the deck is simply filled with good creatures and does not rely on synergy. Pyroclasm kills almost nothing in the deck, and Anger of the Gods still misses several of the larger threats. Wrath of God is a powerful sideboard option, but those effects are not common in Modern. There are simply too few other decks that warrant a Wrath of God when a cheaper spell should do the job.</p>
<p>Most of those threats come down on the first couple turns of the game, which can allow Zoo to hold up removal (Lightning Bolt, Path to Exile), permission spells (Mana Leak, Dispel, Bant Charm), or Collected Company. Counterspells are fairly rare in Zoo, but it has been an effective plan since the first Modern Pro Tour, where Josh Utter Leyton came in second with Counter Cat.</p>
<p>Knight of the Reliquary is a defining card in the slower Zoo decks, as it provides high amounts of power and versatility. To start with, Knight of the Reliquary is roughly 4/4 on turn three, which is already an acceptable rate. The ability can use tapped lands, so KotR can act as a mana ramp creature for Elspeth, Knight Errant, Siege Rhino, Thundermaw Hellkite, or any other finisher in the deck. KotR can simply act as a blocker for a few turns, thinning the deck of lands and easily growing to an 8/8 or 9/9, thanks to fetch lands. The various utility lands in Modern add another level to KotR, providing several different spell effects that can be tutored for. Kessig Wolf Run is the most common target, but Sejiri Steppe, Treetop Village, Raging Ravine, Moorland Haunt, and Vault of the Archangel.   Lastly, a recently printed combo with Retreat to Coralhelm provides a combo finish with KotR, allowing to grow large enough to kill in a single hit. All this together makes Knight of the Reliquary one of the biggest draws to Zoo.</p>
<p>While Zoo is usually Naya colors at a minimum (to support Wild Nacatl), it can easily stretch into blue and black. Tribal Flames is a huge incentive to do this, but Geist of Saint Traft, Siege Rhino, Snapcaster Mage, and Aburpt Decay all provide incentives for the additional colors. The presence of so many colors allows Zoo to have access to all of the most powerful and/or versatile sideboard options available. This includes some powerful cards that simply don’t have a home, like Bant Charm.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span></address>
<p>There is a price to be paid with the manabase. Damage from fetch lands and shock lands adds up quickly and can be very punishing. Some of the more explosive aggro decks in the format, like Burn and Affinity, can capitalize on this painful manabase, and will simply win faster than Zoo. Zoo has an upper limit on how fast it can win, so it has to rely on sideboard cards for those matchups.</p>
<p>Zoo can struggle if its first wave of creatures is quickly removed. Most combo decks are capable of executing their combo within the first four turns of the game. Zoo has a small amount of interaction capable of stopping some of these decks, but holding mana for those spells makes it harder to deploy additional pressure. Zoo will often be forced to discard even the pretense of interactive spells to rebuild the board, and can simply die in response.</p>
<p>The mana in Zoo can be quite complicated, and inexperienced players can struggle with searching for the correct lands. The Naya version of Zoo is fairly simple and more forgiving of mistakes. The five color Zoo decks are much more complicated, and a single mistake can leave multiple cards stranded in hand. These problems can manifest later in the game, so the mistake my not be readily apparent.  It can be difficult to identify what went wrong when Lightning Helix is uncastable because the only white source of mana is also the only red source of mana.  Extensive practice is needed to competently pilot Zoo, simply because of the mana.</p>
<p>Theoretically, Blood Moon would be a strong card against Zoo, but the games do not usually play out in that manner. Zoo can usually apply enough pressure in the first few turns that there simply isn’t a chance to even cast the enchantment. Even if there is time, the existing creatures must be dealt with swiftly, and Blood Moon does not lock out Lighting Bolt. Zoo can sometimes just burn out an opponent through the powerful enchantment.</p>
<address><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Variations</span></strong></address>
<p>The three main types of Zoo are the Naya version and the five color version. It is possible to run Geist of Saint Traft without black, or Seige Rhino without blue, but that is not common. Tribal Flames is too powerful to leave on the bench when you already have four colors in the deck.</p>

<h1>Ad Nauseam</h1>
<address><img id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_cardImage" src="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=174915&amp;type=card" alt="Ad Nauseam" /></address>

<address>Deck Category: Combo</address>
<address><a href="http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=10430&amp;d=259690&amp;f=MO">Sample Decklist Link</a></address>
<address> </address>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Overview/Game Plan</strong></span></address>
<p>This is the deck to play if you like literally drawing all of the cards. The plan is simple to execute, simply cast the namesake card with either Angel’s Grace or Phyrexian Unlife. Those cards prevent you from dying due to revealed cards from Ad Nauseam, allowing you to draw your entire deck. The cards used to actually win the game can vary, but the most popular is Lightning Storm. Conflagrate and Seismic Assault are other potential options.</p>
<p>Due to the critical need to find Ad Nauseam every game, a reasonable amount of the deck is devoted to dig spells. Serum Visions and Slight of Hand are very common, and Peer Through Depths, Spoils of the Vault, and Mystical Teachings all see some play. The expensive mana cost of Ad Nauseam means the deck will take a few turns before it is ready to execute the combo, so this deck is one of the only decks capable of using the Theros temples or Halimar Depths. Those are some strong signals if you are trying to determine if your opponent is actually playing Ad Nauseam. Also, Ad Nauseam happens to be one of the only decks running black mana and Slight of Hand.</p>
<p>Several deck slots are used on mana acceleration, since executing the combo takes six mana or three mana followed by five mana. Pentad Prism and Lotus Bloom usually fill this role. There are usually four copies of Simian Spirit Guide, but three copies are needed to cast the Lightning Storm after drawing the deck.</p>
<p>Any remaining deck slots are usually reserved for protection. Pact of Negation is quite strong at protecting this combo, as the deck wins the turn it casts Ad Nauseam. Counter wars will occur over the actual card Ad Nauseam, because after it resolves, any remaining copies of Pact of Negation will be able to protect the Lightning Storm. A final use of Pact of Negation is aggressively countering an opponent’s threat. A spare Angel’s Grace neutralizes the “lose the game” clause and can help buy time to assemble the combo.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Strengths</strong></span></address>
<p>Ad Nauseam has some distinct advantages over most other combo decks in the format. The biggest is the lack of reliance on either creatures or the graveyard to win the game. All of the faster combo decks in the format can be affected by cards like Path to Exile or Scavenging Ooze. Scapeshift is one of the only other decks to share this strength, but it flirts with a small number of creatures, such as Snapcaster Mage, Sakura-Tribe Elder, and Coiling Oracle. Ad Nauseam completely nullifies the card Path to Exile as an interactive spell, and that is a large edge in Modern.</p>
<p>Lightning Storm is the preferred win condition in Ad Nauseam because it can be cast an instant. Ad Nauseam, Angel’s Grace, and Lightning Storm are all instants, meaning the deck is capable of executing the combo at any time. Any time the defenses are lowered, Ad Nauseam can simply win the game. That kind of flexibility is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Ad Nauseam is incidentally strong against some of the aggressive decks in the format due to the combo’s reliance on Angel’s Grace and Ad Nauseam. Both cards are capable of stalling decks like Burn by one or more turns, often providing enough time to combo off.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span></address>
<p>Ad Nauseam is one of the slower combo decks in the format, and it lacks much in the way of interaction with faster decks. Decks like Infect, Grishoalbrand Reanimator, and Amulet Bloom can simply win before Ad Nauseam can even hope to assemble the combo.</p>
<p>While removal spells like Path to Exile are useless against Ad Nauseam, discard spells like Thoughtseize are still extremely potent. Liliana of the Veil is difficult to play against, since Ad Nauseam needs to deploy lands for the expensive namesake spell while keeping the combo pieces in hand.</p>
<p>Abrupt Decay is still something of an inconvenience, as it can destroy Phyrexian Unlife. It can also blow up Pentad Prisms and Lotus Blooms, which leads to another weakness.</p>
<p>The mana acceleration in Ad Nauseam is fragile, particularly in sideboard games. All of the creature removal spells need to come out of opposing decks after the first game. Any anti-combo cards will come in, but extra spots will probably be filled with whatever Affinity hate the player has, since a card with a possible upside is better than a removal spell that does absolutely nothing. Pentad Prism can simply be destroyed before the turn it is needed. Lotus Bloom is slightly more reliable, due to the combo resolving at instant speed, but it is not immune. If it is targeted before the main phase, Ad Nauseam will not get to deploy a land for the turn before executing the combo.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Variations</strong></span></address>
<p>There are some small deck modifications necessary for Ad Nauseam decks that use Spoils of the Vault. Lightning Storm is less reliable there, since some lands will be exiled during the search. Additional lands and/or a switch to Conflagrate as the win condition are the most common changes. Innovation with Ad Nauseam has been almost nonexistent recently, with the Theros temples being one of the only recent changes.</p>

<h1>Grixis Control</h1>
<address><img id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_cardImage" src="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=394613&amp;type=card" alt="Kolaghan's Command" /></address>
<address>Metagame Percentage: 2%</address>
<address>Deck Category: Midrange/Control</address>
<address><a href="http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=94567">Sample Decklist Link</a></address>
<address> </address>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Overview/Game Plan</strong></span></address>
<p>Grixis has really started to make an appearance in Modern as an evolution of the U/R Delver decks when Treasure Cruise was banned. Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Gurmag Angler started finding homes in those decks until they had completely morphed into a midrange deck that was still playing Delver of Secrets for some reason. Players finally kicked Delver to the curb, and Grixis completed its shift back towards midrange and control. This was about the time Kolaghan’s Command was printed, and the synergy with Snapcaster Mage cemented Grixis as one of the best value-based midrange decks in the format.</p>
<p>There are a lot of similarities between Grixis and the Jund/Junk decks in Modern. The goal of both is to grind the opponent’s resources into dust and then win with whatever is left over. Tarmogoyf is the most fundamental difference between these decks. This giant undercosted monster depletes an opponent’s resources in a different way, forcing a quick response or risk simply losing to a few combat steps. Blue, and therefore Grixis, works in a different way.  This deck is better at drawing extra cards and slower at closing out a game. Grixis still runs some of the giant delve creatures, but they are in smaller numbers and less critical to the overall game plan.  Tarmogoyf decks can occasionally win games with a quick assault, but Grixis will almost never manage that.  The giant delve creatures can act as a Tarmogoyf, but they take a few turns without a Thought Scour.  Relying on two cards to generate an efficient creature is not a recipe for having an aggressive start to a game.</p>
<p>The mix of spells in Grixis is pretty fluid, changing depending on the pilot’s preference and the expected metagame. Most of the allstars will always find a home in some number, like Lightning Bolt, Thoughtseize, Serum Visions, Remand, Terminate, and Kolaghan’s Command. However, it is tough to really expect to know the list of spells in this deck without seeing the specific decklist. Rise/Fall, Tribute to Hunger, Sudden Shock, Shadow of Doubt, Countersquall, and countless other cards could be in the deck, and it is difficult to play against them all. Compounding the difficulty is that most of these cards won’t be present in large numbers. Snapcaster Mage adds virtual copies of those spells, and it can be difficult playing around so many single cards. Vedalken Shackles can sometimes make an appearance in Grixis, which can be difficult for some decks to play around. Academy Ruins is a good indication that Vedalken Shackles is somewhere in the deck.</p>
<p>The creatures are a little less varied through the different lists. Snapcaster Mage, Tasigur, the Golden Fang, Gurmag Angler, and Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy are all common inclusions. Pia and Kiran Nalaar and Young Pyromancer occasionally make appearances. Deceiver Exarch and Pestermite are obvious inclusions in decks running the Twin combo, but differentiating between Grixis and Grixis Twin is difficult until you see one of these creatures. There aren’t many other creatures that make the cut. Mulldrifter or Vendillion Clique are possibilities, but not particularly likely.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Strengths</strong></span></address>
<p>Grixis is the kind of deck you want to take into a field of other midrange decks. If the other deck is happy letting the game go past turn five or, Grixis should be a favorite to win. Grixis can play the value game better than most other midrange decks, giving it an edge.  Because of these prolonged games, skilled players have more opportunities to outplay an opponent.  This is very different from a deck like Hexproof, that is fairly easy to play optimally.</p>
<p>Grixis is customizable to a ludicrous extent. I wrote about a bunch of the options in the Overview section, and that was barely scratching the surface. If you feel like you have a grasp on what decks you will play against, you can adjust your deck to beat them. Playing against tons of combo decks? Better play a few extra discard effects. Maybe there will be extra Amulet Bloom and Scapeshift players? Slot in a couple Shadow of Doubt to wreck their day.  Even without some of the powerful white sideboard cards, Grixis has options to improve against almost any deck.</p>
<p>Overall, the strengths of Grixis are very similar to the other midrange decks in Modern. Some of the specific interactions are different, and those have been thoroughly discussed above. Grixis is slightly stronger against other Midrange decks and slightly worse against linear combo decks. Otherwise, Grixis shares the same strengths and weaknesses of Jund and Junk.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span></address>
<p>Grixis is not the kind of deck you want to take into a field of combo decks. Fewer Thoughtseizes, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Liliana of the Veil make Grixis less favored against linear combo decks than something like Jund or Junk. Instead of running a high level of discard spells like Thoughtseize, Grixis relies on rebuying those cards with Snapcaster Mage or Jace, Vryn&#8217;s Protegy.  This makes it more difficult to find the first discard spell (since there are less overall) and rebuying is both slower and takes more mana. If the first spell wasn’t enough to halt an opposing combo deck, it is completely reasonable for the game to end before another one can be cast.</p>
<p>This is more of a problem against decks like Boggles, Tron, and Storm. Decks like Twin are usually content playing a control deck until they assemble their combo. Grixis is much more adapt at fighting this angle of attack, simply grinding resources down to zero.</p>
<p>Grixis colors simply don&#8217;t have particularly good sideboard cards against Burn.  The most common choices are Dragon&#8217;s Claw and Vampiric Link (mostly to target Eidolon of the Great Revel).  These are not particularly effective, so Burn is a fairly poor matchup.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Variations</strong></span></address>
<p>There isn&#8217;t much in terms of large variations in Grixis Control.  The deck is fairly fluid between a midrange and control deck, but that is based on some specific card choices (Vedalken Shackles, Young Pyromancer, etc).  I haven&#8217;t even seen Grixis splash for Ancient Grudge, a pretty common splash in Izzet decks, but Kolaghan&#8217;s Command fills that need nicely.</p>

<h1>Living End</h1>
<address><img id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_cardImage" src="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=113521&amp;type=card" alt="Living End" /></address>
<address>Metagame Percentage: 3%</address>
<address>Deck Category: Combo</address>
<address><a href="http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=10803&amp;d=261787&amp;f=MO">Sample Decklist Link</a></address>
<address> </address>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Overview/Game Plan</strong></span></address>
<p>With Hypergenesis out of the picture, Living End is the cascade combo deck in Modern. The basic principle is simple, play a bunch of cards with cascade that cost three mana, and only play one card that has a converted mana cost less than three. Voila, the other card will always flip from the cascade. Time Spiral had several suspend cards that work well as the focal point of a cascade deck, but Living End is currently the strongest Modern contender.</p>
<p>Living End can’t play anything besides its namesake card for less than three mana. Fortunately, this isn’t a problem, since the cycling mechanic provides both a way to fuel Living End and allows for productive early turns in a deck that can’t play one or two mana spells. The core of the deck is fairly simple, as there are not many creatures that cycle for a single mana. Monstrous Carabid, Deadshot Minotaur, and Street Wraith always make the deck. Architect of Will sometimes makes the cut, but the cycle cost is somewhat prohibitive, the body is relatively small, and the trigger is marginal at best. Pale Recluse and Twisting Abomination can also show up to round out the number of cycle creatures. Fulminator Mage doesn’t cycle, but recurring Stone Rain with Living End is one of the strongest angles of attack this deck has available.</p>
<p>There are not a large number of tricks in most Living End decks. Beast Within is fairly popular, and Shriekmaw usually makes an appearance. Occasionally, there will be a few quirky cards. Gnaw to the Bone and Blood Moon are occasionally played in the starting 60 cards, but they are more commonly sideboard cards. Simian Spirit Guide is sometimes used for an unexpected mana boost on a critical turn.</p>
<p>Violent Outburst is an important card to remember for a couple reasons. The most important feature is that it is an instant. This means that, like Ad Nauseam, an opponent is never really safe against Living End.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Strengths</strong></span></address>
<p>Living End has some very polarizing matchups. The good matchups are usually fantastic, but the bad matchups tend to be abysmal. Aggressive creature decks like Zoo and Affinity are good for Living End. They commit large amounts of resources to the board, which the card Living End will remove when the deck returns its own creatures to the battlefield. The creatures in the Living End deck are also larger than the creatures normally found in Zoo or Affinity, so they are usually still behind even if they can deploy a second wave of creatures.</p>
<p>Living End is one of the only decks that runs land destruction in the starting 60 cards. Decks like Tron and Amulet Bloom are usually good matchups for Living End. Both of those decks still have a chance though; Amulet Bloom can sometimes execute its combo before Living End can even resolve a Fulminator Mage, and Tron usually plays Relic of Progenitus that can disrupt Living End’s plan. Other than those instances, Living End should be a noticeable favorite in those games. Beast Within can also serve as land destruction against decks that need it.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span></address>
<p>When Living End doesn’t work as a Wrath of God for the opponent, the deck loses a substantial amount of power. If the combo is only generating a few random creatures and not sweeping the board, it just isn’t very powerful. Also, the game doesn’t end for another couple turns after the card Living End resolves, making it one of the few combo decks that cannot win on the spot. If that board sweep doesn’t actually affect the opponent (like Ad Nauseam), Living End can just lose before assembling a lethal board. Living End struggles to win the game before turn five, and often needs more time.</p>
<p>Counterspells, particularly Remand, are a significant problem for Living End. The card revealed by cascade can be countered, and there are only three copies of Living End in the deck. There are few ways to protect against counterspells, since cards like Thoughtseize are less than three mana. Ricochet Trap is one of the only cards available to combat this problem.</p>
<p>Living End does not want to have to combo twice. If something happens to the first wave of creatures it recurs, a second cascade will bring back the opponent’s creatures as well. A lot of the power of Living End is creating a board of creatures against a helpless opponent. If that isn’t the case, the creatures in Living End start to look a lot more embarrassing.</p>
<p>The high density of cycle creatures makes the deck extremely high variance. Living End needs to find a cascade spell, and it cannot run cheap filtering effects like Serum Visions. A hand with several cycle creatures and lands can simply turn into nothing if those cycles don’t find a useful spell. Mulligan decisions are also difficult, since it isn’t clear if three or four cycle cards will even find more action.</p>
<address><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Variations</strong></span></address>
<p>There is not a lot of room for variations in Living End, but a white splash is possible. Sin Collector is the main justification for the splash, along with Pale Recluse’s plaincycling acting as an additional enabler. Any other variations are smaller in scale, like Blood Moons or Gnaw to the Bone. Those are mostly a metagame decision though, and the deck still plays the same.</p>
