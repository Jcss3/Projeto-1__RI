      <tr>
        <td class="main"><P>A recent change in rules has happened in the Vintage format, which is a <BR>popular format amongst many a kitchen table around the world. The cards <BR>Gush, Voltaic Key, Mind Twist and Black Vise have been unrestricted, which <BR>means you can have four of each in any Vintage legal deck. Also, Gifts <BR>Ungiven is being restricted to one per deck.<BR>Gifts Ungiven was a powerful engine for an overpowered deck named after the <BR>card- Gifts Control, as well as for many other decks. The Gifts Control deck <BR>would use several copies of Gifts Ungiven to serve the function of the <BR>older, restricted Fact or Fiction. Which would put certain key cards into the graveyard, <BR>including such mean cards as Tinker, Recoup and Yawgmoth's Will, then use <BR>those cards to Tinker into Darksteel Colossus while maintaining control with <BR>very expensive counterspells.<BR>As for the rest of the cards being unrestricted, who knows what the pro <BR>players will concoct? Frankly, I don't care. The Casual Fringe is about <BR>Casual Magic Gaming, and while many casual circles go by Vintage format <BR>rules, not everyone brings their Moxes and other such crazily expensive <BR>cards to play with while they eat and drink and make merry. However, that <BR>does not mean that the kitchen table games of the world are drastically <BR>underpowered either. So, with that in mind, here's what I'm thinking about <BR>the unrestricting of Gush, Voltaic Key, Mind Twist and Black Vise.<BR>Gush was restricted due to Psychatog, one of the most powerful creatures <BR>ever printed. If your friends play Psychatog decks, be expecting a lot more <BR>Gushes in the near future. This also means that Psychatog decks will tend to <BR>be more blue than black, favoring a high Island count to fuel the <BR>Gush/Psychatog symmetry- this means more draw, control and bounce, less <BR>removal and disruption. Gush also has a place in many mono-blue control <BR>decks that never need more than 3 or 4 Islands in play to counter everything <BR>the opponent plays and then combos out with similarly undercosted draw <BR>spells and plays Brain Freeze for the win, or plays a cheap artifact to <BR>sacrifice for Tinker into a fatty artifact creature like Darksteel Colossus <BR>or Sundering Titan. High Tide/Palinchron combo decks may find a place for a <BR>few copies of Gush, but I doubt this because these decks rely heavily on <BR>having many Islands in play. Gush will also help enable the alternate cost <BR>of one of the less expensive 'free' counterspells, Foil. Gush will be played <BR>directly before a Mind's Desire (probably with mana floating) to increase <BR>storm count or directly after Eye of the Storm resolves. The new Aeon <BR>Chronicler and Kamigawa block's Soramaro, First to Dream each get a +4/+4 <BR>boost out of an alternate cost Gush. I would also like to think that the <BR>blue Ninjas (Higure the Still Wind, Ninja of the Deep Hours, Mistblade <BR>Shinobi and Walker of Secret Ways) will get a nice boost from Gush, because <BR>these Ninjas need little mana to be effective (riding in on low-cost early <BR>fliers like Ornithopter and Cloud of Faeries [I prefer Cloud Pirates myself. <BR>GO PIRATE NINJAS!]) and thrive on having cards in hand like Boomerang and <BR>Counterspells to provide more control and keep the Ninjas on the board safe <BR>from removal and board sweepers. Basically, any casual blue control deck <BR>that can maintain control with 2 less Islands in play during the mid-game <BR>should be running a few copies of Gush, as should any deck packing a good <BR>amount of Islands and winning with storm spells.<BR>Voltaic Key will be untapping Titans and Colossuses here and there, but <BR>more dangerously will be untapping Grim Monoliths and Mana Vaults to play <BR>those Titans and Colossuses (or worse) in the first place. The really <BR>dangerous thing about the Key is its versatility and subsequent <BR>unpredictability. It could find a home in a huge amount of decks. Piloting a <BR>control deck? The key will untap Null Brooch or Icy Manipulator or Isochron <BR>Scepter. Need crazy mana? The key can untap Basalt Monolith or Thran Dynamo <BR>or Gilded Lotus. Need to dig for the combo piece? The key is capable of <BR>untapping your Scroll Rack or Aladdin's Lamp or Wand of Denial. Need to drop <BR>creatures into play for free? The key lets you use Aether Vial multiple <BR>times in a turn. Need to find those creatures? The Key can compliment <BR>Citanul Flute. Make multiple permanents indestructible with the Key and That <BR>Which Was Taken. Need to clear the board? Get Nevinyrral's Disk active a <BR>turn earlier with the key. Need a win condition? Use the Key to untap <BR>Phyrexian Processor or Cursed Scroll or Grindstone or Door to Nothingness. <BR>Decks using Coretapper to get crazy amounts of charge counters onto <BR>Darksteel Reactor will want to use the Key. Decks with Isamaru Hound of <BR>Konda may consider combining Voltaic Key with Sword of the Chosen for the <BR>quick beats. Also, you can respond to your opponent's Kill Switch activation <BR>by activating the Key targeting the Switch- just make sure that they're out <BR>of mana so they can't activate it again, otherwise the Key gets stuck in the <BR>Switch lockdown, until you play another copy- hooray unrestriction! Voltaic <BR>Key can also play tricks with artifacts that care if they're tapped or not, <BR>like Trinisphere, Storage Matrix and Howling Mine. Voltaic Key is also a <BR>1-costed artifact, meaning you can find multiple copies easily with Trinket <BR>Mage and Artificer's Intuition. Also, because it's cheap to play and can <BR>untap other artifacts that generate mana, it could possibly be included in <BR>decks using a storm effect for the win.<BR>Mind Twist is some really powerful discard. It can empty an opponent's hand <BR>very quickly. The idea with Mind Twist is playing early threats (like The <BR>Rack or Nantuko Shade or Hypnotic Specter or Dark Confidant) and then <BR>killing you opponent's hand mid-game. Clearing it of removal for your <BR>threats. Alternately, you can place your bets on Dark Ritual. First turn <BR>Swamp, Dark Ritual, Mind Twist for 2 means both you and your opponent have <BR>lost 2 cards from hand, but you have a land in play and may have forced your <BR>opponent to discard their only mana sources. First turn Swamp Dark Ritual, <BR>Dark Ritual, Mind Twist for 4 means you have lost one less card than your <BR>opponent and have a greater likelihood of forcing them to discard their <BR>early mana sources. Getting threshold for Cabal Ritual into Mind Twist can <BR>ruin opponents, as can Cabal Coffers powering up the 'Twist. Early artifact <BR>mana, especially Sol Ring and Mana Vault, can give the Mind Twist the speed <BR>and the large X value it needs to cause the maximum amount of havoc. Dark <BR>Confidant likes Mind Twist, so it only makes you pay one life to reveal it <BR>and put it in your hand from the top of your library. I must say that <BR>unrestricting Mind Twist means that decks that use it have a greater chance <BR>of drawing it early and wrecking with it, but drawing the second or third <BR>copy will often be superfluous with the opponent's hand already empty. <BR>Here's where Soul Spike comes to town, turning extra copies of Mind Twist <BR>into a drain effect, and along with Contagion and Sickening Shoal, extra <BR>copies can be used to remove threats that made it down to the board before <BR>the resolved Mind Twist forced your opponent to go hellbent. Too bad Dark <BR>Confidant dislikes Soul Spike and Contagion so much. Phyrexian Arena, <BR>Yawgmoth's Bargain and Necropotence are just fine with them though. Of <BR>course, the most wrecking play one can make with Mind Twist is powering it <BR>up with mana from the ridiculously expensive Mana Drain, but Mana Drains <BR>thankfully don't show up at too many kitchen tables.<BR>Black Vise, of the cards that have become unrestricted, is the only one <BR>that deals damage. This means that Black Vise is the only recently unrestricted <BR>card that in and of itself is a very powerful win condition. Black Vise <BR>regularly comes down turn 1 for only one colorless mana and often deals 3 <BR>damage to your opponent on their first turn.&nbsp;It regularly does more damage <BR>in subsequent turns. Like Voltaic Key, Trinket Mage and Artificers Intuition <BR>can find all the multiple copies of Black Vise you are now running in your deck. And while <BR>we're in Blue, you should note that Black Vise is really good with bounce <BR>effects such as&nbsp;Boomerang, Hoodwink, Wipe Away, Capsize. Black Vise turns these <BR>temporary answers to threatening permanents into the massive damage needed <BR>to kill an opponent before they are able to keep&nbsp;one of those threatening <BR>permanents on the board. This does not even take into account mass-bounce <BR>bombs like Upheaval and Evacuation. Be on the lookout for mono-blue decks <BR>packing four Black Vise, four Ebony Owl Netsuke, four Paradox Haze, maybe a <BR>few Viselings and nothing else but bounce and land. If an opponent is <BR>holding cards in hand waiting for a combo piece, Black Vise will hurt them <BR>for each turn they wait around with a grip of cards. The Vise also has a <BR>place in land destruction decks, which usually don't have a solid first turn <BR>play, and can strand the opponent with a grip of cards and no land to play <BR>them.<BR>These are just a few ideas of what can happen with the recent changes to <BR>the rules regarding these cards. Its' up to you, the casual player, to build <BR>the crazy rogue decks with these cards and surprise everyone with your own <BR>innovation.<BR><BR>For the Love of the Game, From the Casual Fringe,<BR>Gabriel Showers<BR></P></td>
