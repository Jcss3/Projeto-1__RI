<p>We&#8217;ve got a lot to cover today, so I&#8217;m gonna skip the introduction and get right into the cards.  If you want to discuss any of the cards further, leave me a message in the comments.  If that doesn&#8217;t suit you, you can find me on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/DoneTheMath">@DoneTh</a><a href="https://twitter.com/DoneTheMath">eMath</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alteredego.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1069" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alteredego-214x300.jpg" alt="alteredego" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alteredego-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alteredego.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
The only part of this card that has me interested is the uncounterable clause.  That gives Altered Ego a tiny chance to see play.  Otherwise, it will be relegated to the Commander tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alwayswatching.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1070" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alwayswatching-214x300.jpg" alt="alwayswatching" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alwayswatching-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alwayswatching.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
Always watching shall forever be nicknamed Tangible Virtue after the original Innistrad’s Intangible Virtue. On a serious note, I actually wrote quite a bit about why I wasn’t super excited about Always Watching.  That lasted until I was directed to Dragonlord Ojutai and Archangel of Tithes.  I&#8217;ve revised my opinion after that, since both of those cards are so good with Vigilance.  The deck is still going to need a heavy commitment to white and be filled with small creatures.  Kytheon, Hero of Akros and Thalia’s Lieutenant seem like the best places to start.  Always Watching interacts poorly with Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Secure the Wastes, two of the premier white threats.  I feel like Always Watching has even odds for finding a home or being left by the wayside.  Finding sufficient support for Thalia’s Lieutenant has the biggest chance to tip the scales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/angelofdeliverance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1071" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/angelofdeliverance-214x300.jpg" alt="angelofdeliverance" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/angelofdeliverance-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/angelofdeliverance.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
With a converted mana cost of eight, Angel of Deliverance better deliver something spectacular.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t.  Bulk rare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Murdering pretty much anything for three mana sounds like a fantastic deal.  Unfortunately, the additional life cost will keep this from seeing the same kind of widespread usage as Hero’s Downfall.  Well, the life and the white mana cost.  Anguished Unmaking’s ability to neatly handle planeswalkers will ensure that this card remains above bulk value, but don’t expect this to spike to twenty dollars anytime soon.  It’s a lot closer to Utter End than Vindicate.<br />
There is some obvious synergy with Goblin Dark-Dwellers.  Mardu loses some appeal with the rotation of Crackling Doom, but I feel obligated to point out how sweet it sounds to recast Anguished Unmaking against a midrange deck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArchangelAvacyn.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1073" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArchangelAvacyn-300x209.jpg" alt="ArchangelAvacyn" width="403" height="280" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArchangelAvacyn-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArchangelAvacyn.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></a><br />
Archangel Avacyn is a great card, and you shouldn’t need me to tell you that.  Avacyn would be a great card even if she had a normal card back, starting with three valuable keywords and a strong ETB trigger.<br />
Aggressive decks should take a good look at Archangel Avacyn.  The trigger prevents creatures from dying to Wrath effects (excluding Languish).  She is a serviceable finisher creature on her own, capable of rumbling with just about anything in the air.  Aggressive decks are also the most likely to have additional creatures to trigger Avacyn’s flip ability, and an aggressive deck will appreciate the three damage to the opponent.  Losing your own creatures to that trigger might be a concern, but Avacyn’s size should mitigate the loss somewhat.<br />
Midrange and control decks should consider Archangel Avacyn as a finisher/pseudo removal spell/pseudo Wrath effect.  Flash is a ridiculous ability, allowing you to leave up counter magic or removal spells during the opponent’s turn, and then cast Avacyn if you didn’t need to respond to anything.  Avacyn works as a removal spell too, flashing in after attackers are declared as a 4/4 Flying, Indestructible creature.  If your deck has some additional creatures (or Gideon tokens), flipping into Avacyn, the Purifier should sweep up most of the creatures in whatever token, Vampire, mono red, or Zombie deck becomes popular.<br />
If you are playing a white deck, I’m going to save you some time.  Archangel Avacyn is great.  You should try to fit her into your deck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArlinnKord.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1074" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArlinnKord-300x209.jpg" alt="ArlinnKord" width="402" height="280" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArlinnKord-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArlinnKord.jpg 446w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></a><br />
I’ve got some fond memories of Huntmaster of the Fells, and Arlinn Kord pretty much hits all those points.  She has a ton of different abilities, both strong and synergistic.  Let’s get down to them.<br />
The front side +1 gives a creature +2/+2, Vigilance, and Haste.  These all work together, giving any newly summoned creatures Haste and likely enough power to swing through blockers.  The Vigilance might be the most important part, acting as a form of protection for Arlinn Kord.<br />
The front side 0 ability produces a token to defend Arlinn Kord and flips her to the back side.  The token works well with either +1 ability, and serves as another form of protection.<br />
The back side +1 works as a mini Overrun, giving all of your creatures +1/+1.  This is the least powerful ability without support, as you need more than a 2/2 wolf every other turn to truly take advantage of the ability.  Still, Trample is a great way to push through some extra damage.<br />
The -1 ability on Arlinn Kord/Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon is three damage to a creature or player.  I don’t really feel like I need to explain why that’s good.<br />
Unsurprisingly, Arlinn Kord’s ultimate should win you the game.  It looks similar, though slightly worse, than Domri Rade’s ultimate.  The strength of continually flipping Arlinn Kord back and forth makes me think the ultimate won’t be a realistic plan for most decks.<br />
Overall, we have a strong, aggressively focused planeswalker.  She doesn’t defend herself well against large creatures (four or more toughness, so I doubt we will see Arlinn Kord in a midrange shell.  Gideon has a similar set of abilities, but the additional starting loyalty will keep it out of range of cards like Fiery Temper.<br />
If the Eldrazi ramp deck is still playing red and green (likely), Arlinn Kord might find a home there too.  The flip ability that makes a token can protect Arlinn Kord for a turn, and the -1 ability can pair with Kozilek’s Return to take out a larger creature.  However, Eldrazi ramp relies on four cost ramp spells (Explosive Vegetation and Hedron Archive).  There might not be any room for Arlinn Kord in that ramp shell.<br />
Arlinn Kord will definitely find a home in an aggressive or token based deck.  She has fantastic synergy with Nissa, Voice of Zendikar and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar.  She is also just fine in a deck filled with Zurgo Bellstriker and Scourge Wolf.  Arlinn Kord will make her mark in Standard somewhere.</p>

Asylum Visitor should be a key piece of the aggressive Vampire deck.  The stats make it a fine aggressive play on turn two.  Beyond that, it is a proactive Madness card to use with Heir of Falkenrath and Olivia, Mobilized for War.  That matters more than you might think, since you don’t want to be forced into casting Fiery Tempers or Avacyn’s Judgments before juicy targets present themselves.<br />
The ability is just gravy, since the Vampire deck looks aggressive.  Drawing extra cards is always great, but that shouldn’t be the main reason to put this card in your deck.  It’s just icing on the cake.</p>

Forked Bolt is a fine card, and would certainly be playable in Standard right now.  Adding a mana is pretty rough, making it a tolerable rate at best.  With the loss of Wild Slash, this might be a necessity in red decks.  Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy is still legal, and it needs to die on sight.  Avacyn’s Judgment isn’t pretty, but it gets the job done.  Other than that, Falkenrath Gorger, Asylum Visitor, Goblin tokens, Zurgo Bellstriker, and their like all still need to die.  Avacyn’s Judgment is a fine sideboard option to combat aggressive decks.<br />
The Madness ability of Avacyn’s Judgment is something else entirely.  In a deck with reusable discard outlets, Avacyn’s Judgement can be a Rolling Thunder that costs one less red mana.  Wiping the board might be reasonable, but it gives your shock the option of turning into a Blaze.  If you can reasonably make Avacyn’s Judgement into a Forked Bolt/Blaze split card, that is a ton of versatility for a single card.</p>

Behold the Beyond is seven mana to not affect the board in any way.  There might be some cute combo with Omniscience in Legacy, but I can’t imagine a world where this sees any real play outside of Commander.</p>

This is like an Aether Vial for your spells, except worse in pretty much every way.  It costs more to play, costs mana to activate, and requires you to activate it to gain counters.  The gaining counters part is also mandatory, so removing a large amount of the flexibility.  Aether vial starts netting you mana almost immediately.  Brain in a Jar finally nets you a mana on your third spell, provided you actually cast something at one and two mana.  The ability on Brain in a Jar to remove counters can help mitigate the mandatory additional counter, but it is expensive to use.  Lastly, Brain in a Jar doesn’t prevent the spell from being countered the way that Aether Vial does.<br />
There might be a few niche places for Brain in a Jar.  It does let you cast sorceries on your opponent’s turn.  If you have some need to cast Day’s Undoing, this might be the best way to do it.  Otherwise, it might be a decent way to grind value out in a control mirror.  Seer’s Lantern might be the better option if you want a card like that.</p>

This might be a necessary evil for decks looking to deal with Hangarback Walker, Relentless Dead, or Deathmist Raptor.  Otherwise, don’t expect Blaze to be a tournament staple.</p>

I was going to come up with a bunch of analogies for how bland this card is, but I lost interest.  Bygone Bishop isn’t an embarrassing card, but it is certainly underwhelming.  If a white aggressive deck desperately needs a three cost creature, this would work.  The power level here is just high enough that it could see play.  That is, until something better comes along.  It doesn’t work directly with Collected Company, but it does trigger a bunch off of creatures common in that kind of deck.  If Bygone Bishop has a home, it will be in a deck like that.</p>

Mana accelerants like this need to be cast on curve.  Corrupted Grafstone needs some something in the graveyard to work, so you are pretty much Limited to a one mana play on turn one to turn it on for maximum benefit.  Duress and Traverse the Ulvenwald are really the only things I’m interested in casting on turn one, and I’m not even that excited by those.  Playing any tapped lands will further hinder the use of Corrupted Grafstone, since you might not even have a chance to cast something that first turn.  If this makes the cut, I can only imagine it is because the ramp deck decides that Traverse the Ulvenwald and Ruin in Their Wake can support it.</p>

This screams combo piece, but I have no idea what to pair it with.  I’m sure there is a four card combo out there that this completes, but I don’t see it having success in Standard.  I’ll be waiting for all the brewers to prove me wrong.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/4cd5cs/standard_the_aristocrats_of_westvale_abbey/"><em>This Reddit thread is my current frontrunner for Cryptolith Rite combos.</em></a></p>

This looks like about the best we can expect for ramp spells out of green these days.  Deathcap Cultivator is a fine role player in a ramp deck, and it has the best kind of Delirium ability.  The Deathtouch isn’t something I care about early on, I don’t want to block with this card as soon as I cast it.  Late in the game, when it is most likely that I’ve incidentally turned on Delirium, Deathcap Cultivator can still be relevant.<br />
If you expect to be playing green decks with expensive cards, pick this guy up.  It does exactly what you want it to do.</p>

Apparently Path to Exile and Maelstrom Pulse had some kind of hybrid baby.  Two mana for an exile effect without any restrictions is a great deal, and it isn&#8217;t something we&#8217;ve had access to in Standard in quite a while.  There are a few drawbacks we need to consider.  The opponent gets a Clue token, so they eventually get to draw a card to replace what they lost.  Secondly, Declaration in Stone is a Sorcery, which places large restrictions on timing with removal.   It will be competing with Stasis Snare and Silkwrap, and time will tell if Declaration in Stone can come out on top.  If the format is focused towards tempo, Declaration in Stone will be a fantastic card.  The opponent might just never get a chance to crack open the Clue token.  If the format is focused on grinding out value, Declaration in Stone gets a lot worse.  This is one of the only clean answers to Ormendahl, Profane Prince, and it is cheap enough to deal with a Jace, Vryn&#8217;s Prodigy before it can activate.  There isn&#8217;t another card in Standard that can reliably do that.<br />
I mostly glossed over the ability to snag anything else with the same name.  If Declaration in Stone sees widespread play (think Detention Sphere), the ability is mostly gravy.  Otherwise, Declaration in Stone will still see some occasional play to fix a specific problem (think goblin tokens).</p>

Six mana Wrath effects have a long and glorious history of rotting in bulk boxes.  However, I think this one might have an edge over most of the rest.  The cost of a board clear has gone up in recent times, with most of the Wrath effects now costing five mana.  The previous two white Wrath effects (Planar Outburst and End Hostilities) had additional bonuses, but those only mattered in the smallest percentage of games.  Generating a 4/4 Angel is a real bonus, and it’s completely free if you have Delirium (no awaken cost for this finsher).  Effects like this prevent control decks from needing to run as many win conditions, focusing more on cards that stabilize and control a game.<br />
Delirium will be difficult turn on if you don’t actively pursue it.  Anyone who has played with Tarmogoyf in older formats knows it is harder to get more than four types of cards in a graveyard.  The easy solution is to say that Jace, Vryn’s Protegy fixes everything, but that’s really a cheap answer.  I think the biggest support card for Descent Upon the Sinful will be Epiphany at the Drownyard.  Properly playing Epiphany at the Drownyard will either draw you a ton of cards or quickly set up Delirium for any payoff cards you might want to run.  Descent Upon the Sinful definitely qualifies as a solid payoff card.<br />
I kinda glossed over the exile effect to get to the business of the Angel token, but that is another incentive to play Descent Upon the Sinful over Planar Outburst.  Deathmist Raptor, Relentless Dead, Diregraf Colossus, Prized Amalgam, and generic creatures for Delirium are all better off exiled.</p>

The more zombies you have in your deck, the better Diregraf Colossus is.  It is great on turn three as a 2/2 creature that gives you a Zombie token for every Zombie you cast.  Diregraf Colossus is great on turn eight as a gigantic creature that still happens to spit out tokens every time you cast a Zombie.  This is one of the best payoff cards for focusing on a Zombie tribal deck.  I can’t imagine any deck that calls itself a Zombie deck not running four of these.</p>

This is exactly the sort of trap card you should try to avoid when building a Delirium deck.  By the time you can return this to play, you won’t be needing another colorless source of mana anyway.  Beyond that, the option comes at the cost of colored mana in your deck, which is looking to be at a premium in the coming months.<br />
If you are considering Drownyard Temple for a Madness deck, I’m less skeptical.  Your deck will need to be consistently leaving up mana for other spells (like Void Shatter) before it is a reasonable suggestion.  More importantly, your mana needs to support it.  There is no chance you can play this in a three color deck, and the mana might still be tough in two colors.<br />
If Drownyard Temple is going to see any play, I expect it will be part of some grindy engine.  Cards that come to mind are Aggressive Mining, Constant Mists, Dust Bowl, Restore Balance, and Smokestack.  I’m sure I missed some good ones, but those give a good idea as to the kind of home I expect Drownyard Temple to find.</p>

Almost a reprint of Ghostway, Eerie Interlude has a reasonable chance at seeing some play.  Collected Company already encourages deck construction to focus on cheap, tempo based creatures, and Eerie Interlude can serve double duty to both retrigger any abilities and to protect against Wrath effects.  The only problem is that Collected Company decks can only run a finite number of non-creature spells, and Dromoka’s Command is already a proven candidate for those spots.<br />
Even if Eerie Interlude doesn’t see play in a Collected Company deck, it should never drop down into bulk prices.  Players will try the card simply to avoid Wrath effects in any white deck, and it might even work better now that most sweepers cost more mana than they did when Ghostway was printed.  More importantly, Descent Upon the Sinful might become the default Wrath effect, and this can negate the Exile effect.<br />
Overall, Eerie Interlude may feature as a role player in a Collected Company deck, and it will likely see fringe play regardless.  Some sort of Kalastria Healer deck might be interested too, based off of some kind of Rally the Ancestors/Aristocrats/Soul Sisters deck.  March from the Tomb comes to mind too.  I’ve probably gone a little too deep on that one though.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ElusiveTormentor.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1093" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ElusiveTormentor-300x209.jpg" alt="ElusiveTormentor" width="402" height="280" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ElusiveTormentor-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ElusiveTormentor.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></a><br />
With a reasonable size body, we have to look at the abilities on Elusive Tormenter to determine just how good it is likely to be.  Paying a mana and discarding a spell gives it protection from just about everything, but those are real costs.  Even in the Vampire deck, you won’t always have a card in hand to discard (Madness or not), and leaving up a mana for protection can be cumbersome.  It takes another three mana to get Elusive Tormenter back into a sizeable body, further delaying any additional board development.  Overall, the card has awesome flavor, but I don’t see it making an impact in constructed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/engulftheshore.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1094" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/engulftheshore-214x300.jpg" alt="engulftheshore" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/engulftheshore-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/engulftheshore.jpg 318w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
This is a fairly solid tempo play for a control deck that is just looking for time.  If you already plan to sweep up everything with a Wrath effect, Engulf the Shore can buy a turn or two for you to get some breathing room.  A high Island count will be critical, since any creature you miss is likely to be the biggest one the opponent had.  I could see this as a potential card in slower decks, but it could easily miss the mark and sit on the benches for its time in Standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/epiphanyatthedrownyard.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1095" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/epiphanyatthedrownyard-214x300.jpg" alt="epiphanyatthedrownyard" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/epiphanyatthedrownyard-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/epiphanyatthedrownyard.jpg 545w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
Scalable draw spells will usually see at least a little bit of play, and I am fairly certain that Epiphany at the Drownyard will find a home in Standard.  The draw ability is quite good, even with the poor showing of Steam Augury.  Attempting to compete with Sphinx’s Revelation and Dig Through Time pretty much left Steam Augury in the dust.  Epiphany at the Drownyard is better than Steam Augury in several ways.  The flexibility is both the best and the most obvious.  This card can just draw a card for two mana and can draw the same number of cards as Sphinx’s Revelation at six mana.  The implications for Delirium are the other big draw to Epiphany at the Drownyard.  Filling the graveyard for Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy and Descent Upon the Sinful is a real bonus, and arranging less favorable piles could be an acceptable cost for those cards.</p>

People waiting for the Unburial Rites reprint are probably going to be disappointed.  Five mana reanimation spells have been legal in Standard for several years now, and none of them have been good enough.  The Madness theme in Shadows over Innistrad might change that, but I mostly doubt it.  I don’t expect this one to see play outside of some casual games.</p>

Red is going to happily play a 2/1 for one mana, so this card is guaranteed to find a home.  If you plan to play red decks in the coming months, pick this card up.  You’ll need it.<br />
If you plan to play a Vampire deck, Falkenrath Gorger and Olivia, Mobilized for War are the draw to red.  A two power creature on turn one will provide the pressure that the deck wants.  The synergy with Olivia, Mobilized for War is outstanding, making it almost trivial for you to give any future Vampire Haste and a +1/+1 counter.  Falkenrath Gorger will find a home with the vampires along with the mono red deck.</p>

This is an interesting cross between Howling Mine and Black Vise.  There might be a home for this somewhere in Modern, since the card pool offers some real options for this kind of deck.  I don’t think Standard will be getting the support for a Howling Mine deck, so I don’t expect this to see any play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The ability is both different and really cool.  Unfortunately, the body and mana cost don’t really match up well for constructed.  Flameblade Angel will sit as a bulk rare unless some really strange combo emerges.</p>

I think there are a few chances that this thing sees play.  The first is in the obvious Zombie shell, where it can dig you into new cards and provide synergy for Relentless Dead, Diregraf Colossus, and Prized Amalgam.  The other strategy is with Sphinx’s Tutelage, since it gives you a large number of triggers.  In either case, the body is somewhat fragile; Fiery Temper neatly sends Forgotten Creation to the graveyard. I’m not sure that a Hill Giant has what it takes, even if the ability is good.<br />
Skulk does at least make this a passable threat in the Zombie deck.</p>

Three tokens for five mana isn’t exactly a great rate, so that won’t be the reason this card sees play.  The Madness ability might be a little harder to trigger in a Zombie deck than in a Vampire deck, but making a horde of zombies might cause this to see a little play.  I did miss the extra life this gives, which gives a slight bump to From Under the Floorboards.  Still, I don&#8217;t see this being more than a cute singleton in a deck.  I would probably stay away from this card.</p>

This is the efficient threat that mono red beatdown was looking for.  Three power and Haste is a solid deal for a red deck, and this has the chance to get even bigger.  Beyond that, any additional werewolves that make the deck are slightly better just by Geier Reach Bandit being in the deck.  The transformed side of cards is almost universally better than the front side.<br />
If you are going to play mono red aggro, Geier Reach Bandit probably has a place in your deck.</p>

I really want to love this card, but I think the numbers are just a little too far off to really break out in Standard.  When you hit five mana, Geralf’s Masterpiece will likely be about a 5/5 creature.  A 5/5 flyer for five is not something blue has historically been interested in.  The recursion ability is nice, but losing three cards is a huge chunk of cardboard.  Even if some of those cards have a Madness cost, the additional four mana to activate the ability will prevent you from casting more than maybe one spell.  This is particularly true if you are holding lands in your hand to use the ability in the first place.<br />
I see a little too much Skaab Ruinator in Geralf’s Masterpiece for it to really break out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This format looks to have pretty atrocious mana.  Bad mana usually roughly translates to success for aggressive decks, at least at the beginning.  Goldnight Castigator is a solid finisher for any deck that wants to deal out damage as fast as possible.  It is a high risk, high reward card, but red decks should be willing to pay a pretty high cost for a four power flyer with Haste.  Thunderbreak Regent might be hard to beat out, since it is much safer against other aggressive decks.  If things don&#8217;t go your way, can serve as a road block if you opponent isn&#8217;t going wide.  As a worst case, I expect Goldnight Castigator to see some play out of sideboards as an ace against control decks.  Realistically, I see it as a solid finisher for aggressive red decks and a metagame call for midrange decks like Eldrazi red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This is a two mana 2/2 with no ability for at least a turn.  It has the chance to turn into a larger creature and generate Human Cleric tokens, but that initial turn of weakness is a tough hurdle to overcome.  Mostly, Hanweir Militia Captain just feels like a win-more card.  It’s great when you are already ahead and truly awful when you are falling behind.</p>

I read Harness the Storm several times before I saw the reminder text hidden in the card.  That took it from a reasonable Modern playable to the realms of janky combo decks and bulk rares.  You probably need to trigger this at least twice before you have justified the cost of playing Harness the Storm.  You likely need a third trigger before you start gaining real value.  That seems like too many hoops for me to be interested.  Stay away.</p>

This is a 3/3 for three mana with an extra ability, so it can’t be that bad.  That said, it isn’t that good either.  By the time you have Delirium, this will likely be dying in combat or have already been dispatched by a removal spell.  I don’t see a bright future for this ooze.</p>

Classic card disadvantage.  When you lose the creature, this is going with it.  I might have been interested if this gave Hexproof like the original Geist of Saint Traft had, but I’m certainly going to pass this by the way it is now.</p>

I’m going to compare this card to Ob Nixilis Reignited, since the cards are so similar in their abilities.  I’ll discuss the differences after<br />
Jace’s +1 is clearly better.  A scry trigger is a significant bonus and losing a life is a drawback.  Simple enough.<br />
I wrote quite a bit about Jace’s -2 ability thinking it was actually a -3 cost.  That difference is pretty substantial, since you can use it twice in a row after casting Jace.  As a comparison with Ob Nixilis Reignited, Murder is a better effect than Unsummon normally, so I’d have to give the nod to the black planeswalker.  Getting two shots out of the unsummon makes it much closer too.  I did spend some time considering where an Unsummon would be the better effect, and Ormendahl, Profane Prince was the best example I could find.  I don’t know how common the transforming land will be, but activating it a second time seems like a stretch.<br />
Jace’s ultimate looks worse than Ob Nixilis’s, as long as the game is going to last a couple more turns regardless.  Ob Nixilis’s ultimate will win the game in a relatively short time, while Jace’s doesn’t actively advance your own gameplan.  However, planeswalker ultimates are the least relevant part of the card.  This shouldn’t factor in very much.  I don’t mean to belittle Jace’s ultimate ability, it is a strong effect.  You just have to find something else to work as a victory condition.  Jace can’t actually make your opponent lose the game.<br />
Overall, I think Jace is the stronger card by a small margin.  Ob Nixilis would prefer a deck with a source of life gain, but it increases the amount of spot removal in a deck.  Jace’s draw trigger is much better, but the deck needs other sources of creature removal.  I expect decks that can play both will use the existence of Jace, Vryn&#8217;s Prodigy as the deciding factor.  The playablity of Jace will really depend on how slow the format is.  If Standard is slow enough, Jace will shine.  If Standard is a lot of Goldnight Castigator and Olivia, Mobilized for War, Jace is going to look pretty bad.</p>

A four mana 4/5 Flying trampler is a great card, and nobody is going to argue that.  The trick will be consistently activating the Delirium trigger or being aggressive enough to ignore the damage.  Unfortunately, you can’t do much work before Mindwrack Demon becomes an unattractive option (consider Archangel Avacyn or Sigarda, Heron’s Grace for one additional mana).  That means a couple turns casting cards like Seek the Wilds is far too much setup just to enable Mindwrack Demon.  I&#8217;ve seen some midrange shells that use Mindwrack Demon as a finisher, but I don&#8217;t really like it there either.  Getting an Instant and Sorcery in the graveyard is fairly easy, but creatures might be a little harder.  Lands (Evolving Wilds) and Enchantments (Dead Weight) are even harder, since there won&#8217;t be more than four of each. That leaves Mindwrack Demon as a value card for decks already interested in a self mill plan, where it decent finisher and a strong blocker for Avacyn, Thunderbreak Regent, and Goldnight Castigator.<br />
The last option for Mindwrack Demon is in an aggressive deck as a curve topper.  Something like a Zombie deck would be interested in the initial mill trigger, and an aggressive deck would be happy trading four life from each player each turn.  If you don&#8217;t add anything to support it, the Demon will kill you before the opponent, so be sure you are the aggressor before considering it.  Mindwrack Demon could find a home in a similar place to Pitiless Horde against slower decks, depending on how the format shakes out.<br />
Mindwrack Demon is a sweet card, but the format will have to shake out in just the right way for it to have some time in the spotlight.</p>

I’m really not sure what to make of Nahiri.  I see a mix of Narset Transcendant, Gideon Jura, and a color combination that usually isn’t interested in a long game.<br />
The +2 ability on Nahiri, the Harbinger feels similar, but slightly improved over Narset Transcendant.  Narset had a decent chance to just get you an additional card, but it was a useless effect if it didn’t hit the correct card type.  Nahiri will always leave you with the same number of cards in your hand, but you get to rummage to increase the quality of cards you already have.  Getting cards into the graveyard can also have synergy with Delirium, Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy, and Madness.  Madness is really the only way to actually net true card advantage off of Nahiri, since you can cast the spell and still draw a new one.<br />
The -2 ability on Nahiri is strictly better than the minus on Gideon Jura, since it hits more than just tapped creatures.  Gideon Jura’s plus ability synergized better with Assassinate, but you can always hold Nahiri in your hand until the correct target presents itself.  Nahiri’s ability to end the first turn at six loyalty will probably encourage creatures to attack it, providing additional targets to kill.<br />
The ultimate is extremely low powered compared to some planeswalker ultimates we have seen in the past.  It is still a solid effect, tutoring for the likes of Dragonlord Atarka or an Eldrazi, but it won’t necessarily win you the game.  The power level isn’t too surprising, since Nahiri only gives the opponent two turns to interact before you can use the ultimate.<br />
I do think Nahiri is a strong card, I just don’t know what to do with her.  She has a reasonable +2 ability, a great -2 ability, and a solid and easily achievable ultimate.  Multiple copies play very well together, since you can discard additional copies to find something else.<br />
I just don’t know what white and red deck wants this effect.  Red has very few cards that encourage a long game (Fiery Impulse and Chandra Flamecaller come to mind), and most of white’s cards are pushing for aggression (Gideon, Ally of Zendikar leading the charge).  The mana in this format will probably let you play Naya, especially with Oath of Nissa, but it will be hard to slot Nahiri into a blue or black deck.  I don’t feel like her power is high enough to warrant a deck built just around her, but I could be wrong.  I just don’t know where her home is yet.</p>

I’m going to go ahead and level with you right now.  I can’t evaluate this card without bias.  I’ve had a long and successful history playing black-red vampires in the past, and I would love to see it be a deck again.  That said, I’ll see what I can do here.<br />
This iteration of Olivia is a three mana 3/3 flyer with an extra ability.  Those stats are enough for it to be a playable, but unexciting card, so let’s take a look at the triggered ability.  You can give newly arriving creatures Haste and +1/+1 at the cost of a card.  The two obvious ways to use this involve Madness and discarding excess lands.  Falkenrath Gorger, Asylum Visitor, and Incorrigible Youths all play well with Olivia’s ability, as well as excess copies of the legend herself.  Avacyn’s Judgement and Fiery Temper are both removal spells that synergize well with a discard outlet.<br />
If vampires are a reasonable strategy in the new format, Olivial will be leading the charge.</p>

This card is going to be best friends with Relentless Dead.  A three mana 3/3 is fine, and it fits in the Zombie trible.  Prized Amalgam, combined with Compelling Deterrence, gives the Zombie deck a real incentive to splash blue.  The Zombie deck will likely splash blue if either of these cards is particularly good in the new format, or if the remaining support has some holes in it.  If the Zombie deck is playing blue, expect to see Prized Amalgam in the deck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rattlechains.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1121" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rattlechains-214x300.jpg" alt="Rattlechains" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rattlechains-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rattlechains.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
Rattlechains makes the second 2/1 for two creature in blue with both Flying and Flash.  Flash is a great ability in a tempo deck, because it allows you to respond to cards when you need to.  If you didn’t need the mana for anything else, you can simply deploy your threat at the end of an opponent’s turn, barely lowering your shields at all.  This and Dimensional Infiltrator could flank Archangel Avacyn in some kind of tempo deck.  Otherwise, it could act as a sideboard answer for planeswalkers in slow, controlling decks.<br />
I don’t have huge expectations for Rattelchains in Standard, but it certainly has a chance of seeing some play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/relentlessdead.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1122" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/relentlessdead-215x300.jpg" alt="relentlessdead" width="215" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/relentlessdead-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/relentlessdead.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a><br />
This is going to be the premier mythic rarity Zombie if the tribe has enough support.  One of the hallmarks of black aggressive decks is some kind of persistent threat.  Menace gets significantly better with cheap creatures, since the opponent simply hasn’t had as much time to deploy additional creatures.<br />
Unlike all of the previous recursive threats (Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, Bloodsoaked Champion, etc…), Relentless Dead can block.  If you are just interested in turning creatures sideways, that really doesn’t matter much.  If you are a control deck looking for a way to do lots of blocking, Relentless Dead is the card for you.  You can simply recur the same copy of Relentless dead for BBB, or buy back one you lost earlier for two generic mana.  Or both, if you have the mana available.<br />
The power level on Relentless Dead is pushed through the roof.  If you want to play with Zombie cards, just start with four copies of Relentless Dead.  There are a lot of exile effects to diminish the recursive effect, but it doesn’t matter.  It’s still good enough to play.<br />
Lastly, I love the call back to the card Endless Ranks of the Dead.</p>

What a flavorful card and really great art to match it.  Leave it in your trade binder to gaze at admiringly until someone else wants it.  It won’t be seeing play outside of Limited.</p>

If you are playing a mono red deck without any tribal themes, Scourge Wolf is worth a second look.  You are mostly playing it as a 2/2 first strike creature, but that might just be better than the alternatives.  Don’t expect to be activating the Delirium ability with any regularity, it isn’t a strength of the color red.  It will cost you too much time or too many resources for too little return.  Simply, if your mono red deck wants a 2/2 first strike creature, Scourge Wolf has your back.  Ignore it otherwise.  One last thing; this totally feels like an uncommon or even a common.  Either this card is better than it looks or it proved too good to constantly appear in limited decks.</p>

If there is a green deck that really works to flip its own library into the graveyard, Seasons Past is a solid payoff card.  Realistically, it is a lot more like Praetor’s Council, and will stick to the Commander tables.</p>

Effects like this are quite volatile, and usually not successful in competitive events.  The best case scenario is this doubling your giant army and locking up the game for you.  At other times, this can literally do nothing.  Casual card, and probably worth a solid $5 in about a decade.</p>

You can examine the tournament success of Angelic Overseer to see how the new Sigarda will fare.  I know the effect isn’t quite the same, but situational Hexproof is very different from Hexproof.  Sigarda can’t actually protect itself, making it even worse.  I don’t see any real future for this card outside of Angel collectors.</p>

There is a chance a deck could play enough targeting spells to make this good, but I’m skeptical.  I would stay away unless you get a lot of proof to the contrary.</p>

If you are playing this card expecting the next Dark Confidant, you are going to be horribly disappointed.  Midrange and controlling red decks should not touch this card.<br />
On the other hand, I think this is a fine card in the red aggressive decks.  It’s not fantastic, since it doesn’t do anything on the turn it comes into play, but it does improve the quality of the card you draw for the turn.  At the absolute worst, it is clearing a land off the top of my deck to prevent me from drawing it, and everything else is just gravy.  The bigger problem is the two toughness, since that is dispatched by almost all of the removal spells available.</p>

Down to the last planeswalker of the set.  Let’s go over the abilities one at a time.<br />
The +1 ability draws you a card and makes your opponent lose life equal to its converted mana cost.  That’s certainly better than Ob Nixilis’s draw ability, and likely better than Jace, Unwraveler of Secrets unless you are digging for something specific.  With enough defenses, this is a sufficient plan to win the game on its own.  It has less guaranteed damage than Elspeth, Sun’s Champion or Chandra, Flamecaller, but provides you with an additional card as a resource.<br />
The -X ability deals X damage to a creature or planeswalker and gains you X life.  The playability of Sorin, Grim Nemesis is going to come down to how often this will be sufficient to stabilize the board.  It does a great job taking care of Chandra, Flamecaller or a single fairly large creature, but a horde of goblin tokens is going to make it look like a joke.<br />
The ultimate ability should lock up the game if Sorin survives long enough.  The ability generates a lethal number of lifelink tokens, which should mop things up nicely.  If it doesn’t, it should gain you enough life to find another way to win.  It is weak to a Wrath effect, but that hopefully won’t be an issue after drawing several extra cards.<br />
This last season of Standard was starting to shape up as a battle of Chandra, Flamecallers.  If nothing else, Sorin does a great job of taking care of Chandra while staying alive himself.  If that’s not the case this time around, Sorin can still do work as a finisher in control decks.  He draws cards and can actually kill the opponent with the same ability, which is a rare feat for a planeswalker.  However, he will be quite weak the turn he comes into play.  You will need sufficient board control for him to survive, or the -X ability will need to get you to parity.  Otherwise, he isn’t much better than Unholy Hunger.  Keep that in mind as you build a deck around him.  Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Secure the Wastes seem like a great place to start.</p>

I could actually almost get interested in Soul Swallower.  If you are already interested in a self mill strategy, this can attack as a six powered trampler on turn five.  Unfortunately, both Fiery Impulse and Fiery Temper have plenty of time to kill it before the first Delirium trigger.  If the format doesn’t move towards those spells, Soul Swallower could have a chance.  Of course, you still need to be interested in milling yourself on turns 1-3 for Soul Swallower to even be a consideration.  This would be nothing more than a cog in that kind of deck, and a fairly replaceable one at that.</p>

Startled Awake has all of the signs of one of the original mythic rarity cards.  Cool, somewhat strange, and not remotely based on power level.  A Sorcery that has a flip side would have already been confusing for a new player.  Add the insane power level for 40 card decks, and I’m sure it wasn’t a hard choice to up the rarity.  You might have noticed I haven’t said anything about this card for constructed.  There is a reason; stay away.</p>

There is the outside chance this could be some combo piece if you can reliably generate three or more Clue tokens each turn.  I doubt that is a reasonable plan, so I don’t expect Tamiyo’s Journal to see any play outside of Commander.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Apparently Champion of the Parish has a bigger, more expensive cousin.  Thalia’s Lieutenant trades a little bit of early aggression for an ability that makes it relevant as a later draw.  This is a solid example of a build around card.  If there are enough humans to warrant a deck, Thalia’s Lieutenant will be a strong piece of the deck.  If the pieces aren’t there, it will rot on the sidelines.</p>

<a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hypnotoad.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1146" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hypnotoad-300x300.jpg" alt="Hypnotoad" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hypnotoad-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hypnotoad-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hypnotoad.jpg 584w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
I’m not really sure what to make of The Gitrog Monster.  Well, beyond the fact I’m just going to call it hypnotoad.  Hypnotoad has a fine rate, but nothing outstanding for constructed play.  That means we need to make use of the abilities.  That means we need to be doing something specifically to sacrifice lands; getting the trigger once a turn and only after it survives a full turn cycle won’t be enough.<br />
Any deck that wants to play hypnotoad will need some kind of synergy with the ability.  It doesn’t have to be much, since it is almost playable on its own.  Anything with a self-mill theme could use it.  I just don’t know if the pieces exist for a deck like that in Standard.  Hypnotoad and Mindwrack Demon do make a pretty aggressive pair.<br />
Outside of Standard, there is certainly a possibility for hypnotoad.  Life From the Loam, Dakmor Salvage, and Seismic Assault come to mind immediately.  Raven’s Crime and Flame Jab aren’t far behind.  I haven’t played many Life from the Loam strategies, so I’m not really qualified to build a deck for hypnotoad.  I’m pretty sure Golgari Grave-Troll or Seismic Assault should be involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ThingintheIce.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1137" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ThingintheIce-300x209.jpg" alt="ThingintheIce" width="402" height="280" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ThingintheIce-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ThingintheIce.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></a><br />
Thing in the Ice is going to need some field testing to see if it has chops in constructed.  My initial guess is that it has potential in Standard, but I’m growing increasingly less certain that it has a chance.  I look at it as a high variance Wall of Omens, drawing a free giant monster + Evacuation after some number of turns.  The real question is how many turns will it take to flip it.  Is it possible to play a deck with more than ~15 Instants or sorceries in Standard?  Can that be done excluding any Wrath effect?  A control deck might be the first look, but lands and planeswalkers will be clamoring for spots in the deck too.  Some sort of blue-red prowess deck might be more likely, since those can be packed with Expedites and Slip Through Spaces.  I’m not sure if that kind of deck has any legs to stand on after losing Treasure Cruise and Monastery Swiftspear.<br />
The other concern in Standard is just how relevan the 0/4 body can be.  If the aggressive deck in the format revolves around Heir of Falkenrath and Incorrigible Youths, a 0/4 body is going to look pretty embarrassing.  If the aggressive decks are full of Scythe Leopards and Makindi Sliderunners, a 0/4 wall looks fantastic.  It will take a few weeks to see how the format settles out before we can know this answer.<br />
Older formats might want to take a second look at Thing in the Ice.  Casting four Instants and Sorceries is a lot easier when you have access to things like Lightning Bolt and Gitaxian Probe.  Thing in the Ice is not as good as Tarmogoyf, and I feel confidant saying that.  Tarmogoyf provides an immediate impact and is still functional when it is drawn late in the game.  Thing in the Ice has a higher ceiling, but a lower floor.  However, there are several blue based Tarmogoyf decks in Modern and Legacy that could explore Thing in the Ice as an opportunity to abandon green altogether for another color.  That is the most likely scenario I see for Thing in the Ice seeing play in the eternal formats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TirelessTracker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1138" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TirelessTracker-214x300.jpg" alt="TirelessTracker" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TirelessTracker-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TirelessTracker.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
There aren’t a ton of ways to generate Clue tokens in constructed that I’m excited to play with.  If you got a counter for generating Clue tokens, I’d be more interested.  The way it is right now, it’s a little too mana intensive to get Tireless Tracker out of Dead Weight range.  I expect this to be a bulk rare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/totheslaughter.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1139" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/totheslaughter-214x300.jpg" alt="totheslaughter" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/totheslaughter-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/totheslaughter.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
I was really excited when I saw this card, since I would like access to a mono colored card to handle opposing planeswalkers.  However, To the Slaughter can be filed with removal like Ultimate Price, waiting for the correct metagame to make an appearance.  If Dragonlord Ojutai takes off as a pillar of the format, To the Slaughter will be a solid choice.  If Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Nissa, Voice of Zendikar, or Arlinn Kord (who all make tokens) make up a large chunk of the metagame, To the Slaughter will land on the sidelines.  I don’t even want to think of a format filled with Dragon Fodder where you contemplate this card.  That will just be embarrassing.<br />
Everything I mentioned above ignores the possibility of a dedicated Delirium deck.  If you are guaranteed to snag a planeswalker and anything else, this will be a solid removal spell.  Quickly slot copies into that deck and enjoy a solid, if unspectacular payoff card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/traversetheulvenwald.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1140" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/traversetheulvenwald-214x300.jpg" alt="traversetheulvenwald" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/traversetheulvenwald-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/traversetheulvenwald.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
I expect this to be competing with Oath of Nissa for most of its time in Standard.  I like Oath of Nissa a lot in decks that just want an effect to smooth out draws, but there are a few scenarios that I like Traverse the Ulvenwald in more.  The first is in a dedicated Delirium deck.  This quickly turns into Green Sun’s Zenith, finding you whatever creature you need.  The second is in a ramp deck with Ruin in Their Wake.  In the ramp deck, Traverse the Ulvenwald acts as theoretical copies of Waste to turn on Ruin in Their Wake in the early turns.  In the late game, Traverse the Ulvenwald still turns into Green Sun’s Zenith, tutoring for whatever threats the ramp deck leans towards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Triskaidekaphobia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1141" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Triskaidekaphobia-214x300.jpg" alt="Triskaidekaphobia" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Triskaidekaphobia-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Triskaidekaphobia.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
Insanely flavorful card.  Casual players will have tons of stories.  Constructed players will not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ulvenwaldhydra.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1142" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ulvenwaldhydra-214x300.jpg" alt="ulvenwaldhydra" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ulvenwaldhydra-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ulvenwaldhydra.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
The easy comparison is to Primeval Titan, where Ulvenwald Hydra clearly comes up short.  The hydra is mostly just a giant body, but it can tutor for any land once.  If you have a ramp deck that wants to find a specific land, this might be the card you need.  <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/4cd5cs/standard_the_aristocrats_of_westvale_abbey/">That Reddit article I linked earlier used Ulvenwald Hydra to find Westvale Abbey.</a></em>  Eldrazi ramp decks are considering Ulvenwald Hydra as a decent six cost card, but I don&#8217;t think it does enough to warrant a spot in that list.  Chandra, Flamecaller seems more useful at stabilizing the board.  There probably is a home for the Hydra, but it will take a little while to find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/welcometothefold.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1143" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/welcometothefold-214x300.jpg" alt="welcometothefold" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/welcometothefold-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/welcometothefold.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
Domestication was only playable one of the two times it was printed, and that was specifically as a sideboard plan for a mirror match.  Restrictive Mind Control effects don’t have a great history of success, so Welcome to the Fold will be relying on the Madness cost to see much play.  An Instant speed Mind Control off of a Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy loot seems very good, but a deck will need more Madness enablers than that to play Welcome to the Fold.  If it has a home, I would imagine it in some kind of blue-red Madness deck with Chandra, Flamecaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/westvaleabbey.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1144" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/westvaleabbey-300x209.jpg" alt="westvaleabbey" width="402" height="280" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/westvaleabbey-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/westvaleabbey.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></a><br />
I originally had some problems with this card, but I think I’ve come around.  I felt like there had to be something more I could get out of a utility land, which just seems absurd in retrospect.  I think I was undervaluing the ability to just make a token each turn if you have nothing better to do.  It costs a life, but that cost will be negligible against the decks where the tokens shine.  Against the decks that pressure your life, making a quick Ormendahl, Profane Prince is great.  You can’t ask for much more in a land.<br />
White has several ways to deal with Ormendahl, Profane Prince.  Declaration in Stone, Silkwrap, and Stasis Snare all neatly remove it.  Black has Foul-Tongue Invocation and To the Slaughter, but those might take some setup.  Blue has severa Unsummon effects to chose from.  Green can use Wing Clip as a last resort.  Red is pretty much stone-cold dead to Ormendahl, Profane Prince.<br />
Beyond acting as a utility land, Westvale Abbey is a solid addition to the &lt;&gt; lands needed for Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher.  The red Eldrazi deck from previous Standard is poised to continue performing with Shadows over Innistrad, and there is a gap left from Tomb of the Spirit Dragon rotating.  Chandra, Flamecaller already generates a ton of expendable tokens, reducing the cost.<br />
Lastly, there is a lot of surprise value in an Instant speed Secure the Ranks for five, then starting your turn and playing a Westvale Abbey.  Ormendahl, Profane Prince has Haste, so you can conceal it in your hand for the blowout.  Those two cards can generate an 18 point life swing from nowhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wolfofdevilsbreach.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1145" src="http://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wolfofdevilsbreach-214x300.jpg" alt="wolfofdevilsbreach" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wolfofdevilsbreach-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.wizardscupboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wolfofdevilsbreach.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a><br />
This looks like a really bad version of Arc Slogger.  It doesn’t have Haste, needs to attack to trigger, and requires you to throw away real cards to get the trigger.  I get that Madness can mitigate that last part a bit, but that’s still not nearly enough.  This looks slow, durdly, and everything I don’t want out of a red finisher.</p>
