        <td class="main"><P>In Magic, there are decks built specifically to repeat a near-infinite series 
of actions in order to win the game. No series of actions in magic can be truly 
infinite, but a couple hundred billion stated repetitions will be close enough 
most times. The action in question is often the act of adding a mana to the mana 
pool, resulting in near-infinite mana, but not always.</P>
<P>At first, infinite combo decks were overpowered, and overwhelmed the 
tournament scene during the late 90's. Many players felt as though the 'Combo 
Winter' had broken the game, had ruined magic forever for people who liked to 
attack with creatures and actually interact with their opponent. </P>
<P><A href='index.php'>Magic the Gathering</A> wasn't ruined, and while it's 
true that most infinite combo decks don't do much besides "go off", it still 
takes skill to assemble any game-winning combo in a game of magic, and the race 
to have the combo "go off" before an opponent kills you can involve very 
intense and interactive <BR>gameplay.</P>
<P>Let's start off with a classic combo- Palinchron and High Tide with 7 
Islands. You'll need the first Island to start the combo by playing High Tide. 
After High Tide has resolved, you'll have 12 blue mana at your fingertips when 
you tap out those other 6 Islands. Then you use 7 of those mana to play 
Palinchron. When Palinchron comes into play, you untap up to 7 lands, so all 
those 7 Islands become untapped. You still have 5 mana floating in you mana pool 
at this point, without having to tap your lands again. Use 4 mana to activate 
Palinchron's ability and return it to your hand. 7+4=11, but you had 12 mana in 
your pool before you first cast Palinchron, so you still have that 
oh-so-important single mana floating. Palinchron is back in your hand, you have 
7 Islands untapped, each of which produces 2 blue mana whenever tapped. Now you 
can tap them all, get 14 mana, play Palinchron again (down to 7 mana), untap all 
7 Islands again, activate the Palinchron's Ability (down to 3 mana) and return 
it to your hand. Each repetition at this point will give you 3 blue mana. Repeat 
until the desired near-infinite number of mana is in your mana pool, then use 
the finisher spell- in this case, its usually Stroke of Genius or Braingeyser 
targeting your opponent, milling their library in one fell swoop and causing a 
game loss when they cannot draw on their turn. This combo is the finishing combo 
for many mono-blue control decks.<BR>Here's another classic combo- Grim 
Monolith and Power Artifact. This combo was so powerful (it was the basis of a 
World Champion deck) that Grim Monolith became restricted in the Vintage format 
as a result. Grim Monolith taps for 3 colorless mana, but only untaps for 4. 
Power Artifact enchanting Grim Monolith reduces the untap cost by 2, so it 
produces 1 more than it costs to untap. You tap Grim Monolith, add 3 mana to 
your pool, use 2 to untap it, and then you have one mana in your pool with the 
Grim Monolith untapped. Since this makes colorless mana, you'll need an 
additional blue mana for Braingeyser or Stroke of Genius, red mana for Fireball 
or Disintegrate (or the new Demonfire), or you can forgo the necessity of 
<BR>colored mana and use Rocket Launcher or Goblin Cannon to stack infinite 
damage. I believe that enchanting the unrestricted Basalt Monolith with Power 
Artifact works very similarly.</P>
<P>Here's another combo for near-infinite mana that does not use expensive or 
restricted cards. Ashnod's Altar is an artifact that produces two colorless 
mana whenever you sacrifice a creature to it. Iridescent Drake is a creature 
that has a triggered ability-when it comes into play it returns an Aura card (or 
Enchant Creature) from your graveyard to play enchanting it. False Demise is an 
Aura that causes the enchanted creature to return from a graveyard to play under 
your control when it dies. Once you have the Iridescent Drake enchanted with 
False Demise, you sacrifice it to Ashnod's Altar for 2 mana. The False Demise 
ability triggers, returning the Iridescent Drake from your graveyard back into 
play. Then the Iridescent Drake's comes-into-play ability triggers, 
re-enchanting it with False Demise. You now have your Drake back, enchanted with 
False Demise, with 2 colorless mana in your mana pool, ready to be sacrificed to 
the Altar again and again. For a while, this combo did not work (the Drake had 
errata which made it so that it's triggered ability only happened when you 
played it from your hand), but due to a recent rescinding of the Drake's 
errata, it works again.</P>
<P>Now lets look at a combo that does not create near-infinite mana, but can 
create a near-infinite series of actions that can cause your opponent to lose 
the game. 2 Myr Retrievers and an Ashnod's Altar. Sacrifice the first Myr 
Retriever to the Altar to get 2 colorless mana. Use that mana to play the second 
Myr Retriever. Then sacrifice that second Myr Retriever to get 2 colorless mana. 
When the second Myr dies, it's triggered ability allows you to return the first 
Myr from your graveyard to your hand. Now you have a Myr in your hand, a Myr in 
your graveyard, and 2 colorless mana floating. Cast the Myr in hand with the 2 
mana, and then sacrifice it for 2 more and to return the Myr in the graveyard. 
Repeating this process does not make near-infinite mana, but it does get you a 
near-infinite amount of artifacts going to the graveyard. If you have a Disciple 
of the Vault in play, its ability triggers each time a Myr gets sacrificed to 
the Altar, and so you can cause your opponent to lose near-infinite life. If you 
have a Moriok Rigger in play, you can make yourself a creature with 
near-infinite power and toughness to swing with (I recommend having the Rigger 
equipped with Whispersilk Cloak to make sure it does not get removed or 
blocked). If you are unable to keep a Disciple or a Rigger on the board, you can 
play Tendrils of Agony after you've played a near-infinite amount of Myr 
Retrievers and kill your opponent with copies of Tendrils created by its storm 
ability.</P>
<P>Getting back to near-infinite mana, lets see what happens when I enchant a 
Thran Dynamo or Gilded Lotus with Animate Artifact and have a Voltaic Construct 
in play. I tap the mana-producing artifact for 3 mana. Because the artifact in 
question is also a creature (this can be accomplished with other cards besides 
Animate Artifact, such as Karn's Touch, Xenic Poltergeist, or Karn, Silver 
Golem), it can be untapped using 2 mana by activating the ability the Voltaic 
Construct. The artifact becomes untapped with a mana floating. You know what 
happens from here- repeat the process as many times as you like, then use the 
mana to power an X-damage spell or some other X-mana spell, activated ability or 
effect to kill or mill your opponent.</P>
<P>Another combo that was previously legal in the Standard format is Tidewater 
Minion enchanted with Freed From the Real, with Dimir Aqueduct in play. Tap the 
Aqueduct for 1 blue and 1 black mana, and then tap the Tidewater Minion to untap 
the Aqueduct, and then use the 1 blue mana to untap the Tidewater. Everything is 
untapped, rinse and repeat for that crazy amount of black mana. When this combo 
was standard legal I used Swallowing Plague to gain near-infinite life or used 
Psychic Drain to gain near-infinite life and deck my opponent at the same time. 
For a short window, Dark Depths was also in this standard-legal deck, although I 
haven't got my Merrit-Lage token into play yet I still have the deck together 
so one day I will.</P>
<P>Freed From the Real enabled my friend to figure out another near-infinite 
combo, which seems like it always comes together to fast to react to. By 
enchanting Freed From the Real on Ley&nbsp;Druid or Sachi, Daughter of Seshiro, 
he can then near-infinitely untap Simic Growth Chamber or a Forest enchanted by 
Utopia Sprawl (set to make blue mana) and make near-infinite green mana. His win 
conditions of choice? Either Gruul Guildmage to give all his creatures a 
near-infinite power and toughness boost, or the new Wurmcalling, which is just 
ridiculous with near-infinite mana at hand.</P>
<P>Here's one last infinite combo that is a bit more complex. Remember, the 
more complex a near-infinite combo is, the more likely it is that your opponent 
will find a way to disrupt it and keep it from causing them to lose the game, 
but the more interchangeable combo pieces you have, the more likely you'll get 
the right combination of cards before you opponent can react. Lets consider what 
happens with the following cards. suppose you have the cards Fecundity and 
Mortuary on the table. Mortuary makes it so that whenever a creature dies, you 
must put that creature on top of your library. Fecundity makes it so that 
whenever a creature dies you may choose to draw a card. If you control both of 
these enchantments, you may choose how to stack the effects, and so whenever a 
creature dies, you put that creature on top of your library, and then you can 
choose to draw that creature card. Now consider creatures that can sacrifice 
themselves for the same exact mana that could be used to pay for their casting 
cost- Skirk Prospector, Blood Pet, and Wild Cantor. Whenever one of these 
creatures dies, you can sacrifice it in response to add mana to your mana pool. 
If it is during one of your main phases, you can play creature spells, and so 
you sacrifice the creature for mana, stack the Mortuary and Fecundity triggers, 
get the creature back in hand, and use the mana it originally created to replay 
it. You can sacrifice it again for the same mana and repeat the process as many 
times as you like. Again, spells with the storm ability (like Tendrils of Agony 
or Grapeshot) can win the game here.</P>
<P>What if you need infinite mana for an X spell or a spell with the replicate 
ability, like Pyromatics? This is the time to mention Wild Cantor's combination 
with Tinder Wall, which is a creature that can sacrifice itself for more mana 
than it costs, although there is an issue with the mana's color. With the 
Mortuary/Fecundity combo, you can sacrifice the Tinder Wall for 2 red mana. 
Thanks to Mortuary/Fecundity (M/F), the Wall goes back to your hand. Then with 1 
red mana, play Wild Cantor. Sacrifice the Wild Cantor for 1 green mana, and the 
Cantor goes back to your hand, again courtesy of the M/F combo. With the green 
mana, you can replay the Tinder Wall with the green mana from the Cantor, while 
having one red mana still floating in your mana pool from when you first 
sacrificed the Wall. Repeat the process for as much red mana as you need for 
whatever finishing spells you have in mind.</P>
<P>Often times, infinite combos require a very specific set of cards to occur. 
This makes 'tutor' cards, which search out particular cards, and card-drawing 
effects very important, as they put the essential pieces of the combo into hand. 
Also, time is necessary to put the combo pieces into place, and if your opponent 
is playing an aggressive deck against your combo deck, you may need 
control/removal cards and effects to buy yourself enough time for the combo to 
'go off'. If your combo involves playing a creature card a near-infinite 
amount of times, you may want to consider Glimpse of Nature or Primordial Sage 
to draw into your win condition, and a similar statement can be made with 
artifacts and Vedalken Archmage, or with enchantments and Argothian Enchantress, 
Verduran Enchantress or Enchantress's Presence. Another thing to remember is 
that the more you play your near-infinite combo deck, the more your 
opponents/friends will recognize what you are attempting to accomplish and 
attempt to disrupt your combo. This is especially true in group games, where you 
may find yourself ganged-up-upon by multiple opponents at once while you are 
practically defenseless- the threat of a combo like the ones mentioned above is 
often times enough to draw unwanted attention in multiplayer. Then again, combos 
like the ones mentioned above often have the capability to win a multiplayer 
game by killing all opponents in a single turn, so you can't really blame them 
for not wanting you to outright win just a few turns into what they thought was 
going to be an epic battle.</P>
<P>I hope you've enjoyed this intro to near-infinite combos, and that it will 
inspire you to go out and build a deck that your friends will hate you for 
playing (hey, even the best of friends can be jealous sore-losers on 
occasion).<BR><BR>For the Love of the Game, From the Casual Fringe,<BR>Gabriel
